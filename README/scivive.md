## Dreams Really Do Come True

Have you ever wondered why some people can attain so much, while others can only seem to achieve so little? How is it possible that such a vast difference exists among people in this modern time? This is not an accident. The paths to greatness have followed a similar form for thousands of years. Great things happen to average people every day, and by slightly stacking the odds in your favor, one day people will look up to you, and wonder how you became so lucky.

Here is a little secret: “luck” is simply a combination of preparedness and opportunity.

What else might you say to yourself? Eat healthy, sleep well, love yourself, your family, and your fellow man—you're off to a good start. The first step is to know that you can give yourself great advice, and more importantly, you can follow through on it.

The world of happier, healthier people starts today... with you.

## Fulfill Your Destiny

If you are reading these words, there is already something great about you. You're that rare person who knows the future can be brighter. Your future can be shimmering. You believe in yourself. You know there are better and worse methods to doing and achieving things, and you prefer the better. You like to learn new things, particularly things you'll be able to use effectively. Your entire life has led up to this moment, this turning point, where you found the book that will change your life forever. Today is that day. You will dream the dream, and then you will learn to live it! Your life can and will exceed your wildest dreams.

## Focus on Investing in Life

Is there anything more precious than human life? Than *your* life?

The answer is no. Humans—the *Homo sapiens* species—are the crown of creation, at least here on earth. Therefore, should we not make our number one priority investing in extending human life? Scivive's talking about real dollars and real investment choices that have been proven to be two things:

1. Beneficial in the quest to extend human life.
2. A good investment that can make you very wealthy.

Imagine that! Socially responsible investing—no, make it socially *imperative* investing—in medical and healthcare technology can bring positive returns in both prolonging human life and making stakeholders very wealthy. How much better can it get?

More people make more progress more quickly. Aren't you glad your parents didn't decide the world would be prettier or work better without you in it? If great minds like Einstein, Bell, Tesla, Leonardo Da Vinci, and others were still alive and productive today, the world would be a better place. You're literally asking for others to die out of your fear. The burden should be higher. Have courage. If living longer comes with too many disadvantages, we'll know a century from now and decide then.

## The Longevity Stock Index

We need a longevity stock index. A subset of biotech index, weighted by the high likelihood you might be saved by health technology. Make a profit on the companies that are most likely to be there to save you when you need to be saved. Get rich in the meantime.

Don't overweight on tech that is likely to save others dissimilar to you. This assumes you value your life over others. If you don't, then you should side with Bill Gates, and take the easy saved lives of clean water and mosquito nets.

It's hard to get peoples' money into missions oriented towards longevity, because the time horizon to profit is too far out. It's also hard to get peoples' money into charitable causes, because charities are so often inefficient. Offering people the ability to profit in the short term while enhancing the likelihood the health tech is there when they need it is the only way to mobilize the funds of the masses into saving their mortal selves.

## Intelligent Action Is Power

Knowledge alone isn't power. *Intelligent action* and *using* your knowledge equals power.

Let's be serious, if reading a book on how to get what you wanted was all you needed to do, well, by golly, you'd see a world full of fulfilled, satisfied people.

Knowledge is but the first step. The habits built by taking correct action facilitate the heavy lifting of change. Knowledge without action is like a car with an empty gas tank. It could theoretically get you where you want to go and it's nice that you have a car in the first place, but you also need the fuel to propel it forward. The same rings true in life; knowledge is the stationary car, but action is the fuel.

## The Meaning of Life

“What is the meaning of life?” is a bit of a malformed question. Life could be described in terms of quality multiplied by quantity of years, and nearly everything that increases time also increases the quality, so lucky us!

Also, the question regarding the meaning of life is typically oversimplified and incomplete. You might as well ask, “What is the meaning of bread?”

How do you answer that? “Am I hungry? Am I choking on it? Did I steal it, is it moldy?”

There is no such thing as meaning except what you give it, and perhaps what other entities with power over you give it. Even that changes; what you think about things changes with age, how you've been treated, and how the world has changed.

Why does Scivive feel so compelled to venture down the rabbit hole of intuition, superstition and the occult? It's because they waste everyone's time. So many people waste so much time in unenjoyable ways when they could be wasting it in more fun and thought-provoking ways.

The emptiness of searching for meaning externally is trivial, as the meaning of anything is an individually conceived idea, based on your personal perceptions, needs, circumstances, and mindset.

## The System Works Better When People Are Diverse

Among humans there is great diversity. We are *supposed* to be different. It's the reason we have sexual reproduction. In this world, during the course of life's existence, there have always been living things that can clone themselves. They include sea sponges, tapeworms, aphids, jellyfish, and others. The problem with just making a copy of yourself is that, except for gene mutation and natural selection, it doesn't facilitate the next generation to be better than the one before it. When male-female sex came along, the world rejoiced. Sex is the best way to get offspring that are genetically stronger than what came before them. In fact, many species risk their very lives in order to procreate in this way, such as slate-950 widow spiders and praying mantises. They are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of the species.

This way of reproducing facilitates rapid and effective change, because you're quite literally mixing the blueprints of two unrelated individuals of the same species. Genetic inheritance has its own impulse to be mixed up randomly. We know that in the case of humans, genetics has determined that if you mate with someone closely biologically related to you, it often leads to bad health outcomes for the offspring, and consequently in many places it's illegal.

With reproduction between unrelated partners, you also get this great effect of both (hopefully) of the partners consciously choosing the traits that they like the most out of a large pool of potential partners. This is how future generations gradually become faster and faster, smarter and smarter, prettier and prettier, a direct result of thousands of years of everyone choosing their favorites and mixing it up.

Why does Scivive talk about reproduction in the introduction? Because we're all supposed to be different, and species such as humans with wide variations in abilities, desires, and behaviors are vastly superior in survival to “one trick ponies,” where if the situation changes only a small bit, everyone can get wiped out. If you don't have variation in your species, you are not durable.

The world is constantly changing, it's good to be durable, because durability equals a higher quality of life, as well as quantity; and being an omnivore is fun.

So, if it's good that we are all different, if it's good that we are continually more different than what came before us, then it's also good that we don't all have the same needs in the same priority. Therefore, all of the standard hierarchies of the needs of humans, such as Maslow's, are deeply flawed from the start, because they assume that individuals are similar and have the same needs in the same orders as everyone else.

*Scivive* can assure you we do not, which is good news for humanity.

If we spent time analyzing how wrong everyone is and has been on every subject, we would be here forever. Much better that we use our short and valuable time together focusing on what works and eliminating what doesn't work. Thus, your meaning of life should be slightly different from that of many other people. There is robustness for the system through diversity of opinion and behavior.

## Scivivors

Scivivors are people who are at such a high level of fulfillment that they have the time, money, and desire to invest in their families' survival. They leverage *science* to *survive*.

In that regard, among all life forms on earth, we are unique. No other species but *Homo sapiens* can do that.

## The 9 Core Principles of Scivive

There are nine core principles of *Scivive*. They are:
1. Mind
2. Body
3. Spirit

These first three are “you.” You are your physical body, but also what you think and what you feel. You will inherently become what you do, what surrounds you, and the experiences you have.
4. Money
5. Power
6. Respect

These next three are “amplifiers.” How fast and how well you become your future self are amplified by the money, power, and respect you build.
7. Time
8. Space
9. Experience

These three are what you are in the world.

We know that advancements in medicine have the greatest benefits for our loved ones and ourselves. Science is the best tool we have to take mankind to the next level. Strong-minded individuals fight the Grim Reaper standing up, while cowards kneel and pretend that nothing can be done. When the genie grants us wishes, we wish for more wishes.

A life well lived is one of balance, enjoying today to its fullest while also preparing for tomorrow. Lucky are we that being happier, healthier, and unconditionally loved can add not only joy to our years, but years to our joy.

## Quality x Quantity = Life

Life is quality multiplied by quantity. The quantity factor is simply defined by how many years of life you compile. Quality, however, is being the best you, having more fulfilling relationships and experiences. A great life cut short is tragic, and a long life of mediocrity is tragic just the same.

## The Systems

The systems that helped you into this world and that you may still operate in include education, finance, politics, and these things all affect you on a day-to-day basis. Their scope is usually so large and they have so much momentum that they should be focused on separately from the things you can affect quickly and easily in your daily life. Understanding these larger systems becomes more important as your sphere of influence becomes larger and larger. Much like on giant ships, there's one helmsman who turns the wheel to change direction. You may be that helmsman or, at the very least, have his or her ear one day.

## The Magic Lens of Scivival

A pure white light makes it easier to see everything properly. If you want your personality to shine a pure white light, you need to have all of the colors in balance. When you're out of balance, you will have a tendency to tint everything you look at. Without the correct wavelength balance, you will not see things, or people, for what they really are.

The Magic Lens of Scivival splits the light of life into nine different wavelengths you can tune into. This is one of many gifts that living as a Scivivalist will give you. You'll be able to see and understand things in a way that most people cannot, a much more pure and authentic view.

| Focus | Color | Action | Association |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mind** | Green | Think | Grass, the base, the color we see best |
| **Body** | Red | Move | Blood pumping |
| **Spirit** | Blue | Feel | Moonlight, wonderment |
| **Money** | Orange | Buy | Construction, creation |
| **Power** | Brown | Strike | Earth, sports |
| **Respect**| Pink | Tell | We're all pink on the inside |
| **Time** | Cyan | Do | Blue-shift from speed |
| **Space** | Yellow | Synergize | The Sun powers everything |
| **Experience**| Magenta | Enjoy | Fulfilment of Body and Spirit |

[This doesn't match a real color wheel, which has 3, 6, or 12 colors.]

## The Magic of Sets of Three

You can only focus on so much stuff at one time (chunking). Our brains are a little like our mouths, in that when you want to eat a sandwich, you do it in bites, and if you try to capture too much sandwich in a single bite, the chewing stops working and you just lock up. Your brain is a little bit like that, as it works most effectively when it's given just the right amount of information to digest. That's why splitting quality of life into groups of three is so useful.

Three is a magical number. Think of how many things come in threes.

We all know height, width and depth. We see color with red, yellow, and blue light sensing cells in our eyes.

We describe sound as the highs, mids, and lows.

We describe sizes as small, medium, and large.

It's also the least number of walls you need to enclose a space, best sub positioning, seating position, speaker height, and seating height in room.

Proper sentences contain subject, verb, and object. And plotting vectors require a point, direction, speed.

Let's not forget the rule of threes for photography, and that three points are needed to triangulate a signal in any given space. Additionally, we often see layered items as top, middle, and bottom, and the minimum number of legs required to stand something up with any stability is three.

*Hendiatris* (Greek, meaning “one through three”) is a way of using emphasis (in writing or speech) to describe something by means of including three words to describe a single idea. Input, process, output.

The appeal of the three-fold pattern is illustrated by the transformation of Winston Churchill‘s reference to "blood, toil, tears and sweat” (echoing Garibaldi and Theodore Roosevelt) in popular recollection to “blood, sweat, and tears.” Similarly, Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan describes the importance of community, without which life would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”. This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad, “nasty, brutish and short."

Another example of threes is illustrated when a testimonial oath by a witness in a US court proceeding is asked to “tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth."

The list of examples goes on and on: inch, foot, yard; past, present, future; Earth, Sun, and Moon; morning, noon, and night.

Additionally, the Greek number *Pi* is basically equal to three.

The government of the United States has three branches: executive, legislative, judiciary.

One could say that all this 3 magic is a natural consequence of counting, starting with 1, which isn't exciting; and then 2, which one could find many examples of cool, memorable pairs (Lennon/McCartney, the Wright Brothers), but pairs contain much less information than triplets. And so 3 is the lowest countable number where more complicated effects start happening, because the pairs can only be so exciting. “Rock, paper, scissors” is more fun than just “rock, paper." Because they're so effective in communicating, math, and building, it's worth knowing the power of threes.

## The Symbol of Scivive

*Scivive* is a great name for a movement. It's an action, and all movements require such.

The title *Scivive* is interesting because it invokes the thought of life and mortality. Then when you make it *Scivival*, the “vival” part clues you in to something that's coming to kill you, whether it's someone who doesn't like you, a hereditary disease, or the simple passage of time. Some think it's important to differentiate a belief in survival through scientific advancement, and more than just survival we really want to achieve a better quality of life (not just quantity). You don't want to just have a life that's devoid of happiness to last longer, you want a life that is fulfilling and healthy that lasts longer.

Some self-help books are afraid to give you specific advice, as they like to leave their market appeal broad by being vague in what they tell you. *Scivive* would prefer to tell you the truth. *Scivive* will tell you what's good for you where it can, and when it can be most effective to you, at the cost of cool points and broader vagaries.

## Whoever Influences You First Sets Your Bias

It can be difficult to overcome this initial bias if you do not maintain an open mind. As a newborn, you come in to this world being influenced from all angles. You don't initially get to pick and choose where these biases come from. As you gain more experience and wisdom, however, this begins to change. You can train yourself to follow or seek out more positive influences, and subdue the negative ones, while overcoming hardships and difficult circumstances.

Many great people have been forced into greatness because of harsh circumstances. Life is a splendored thing. Often times what you thought was a curse turns out to be a blessing. All of us have the fortune of misfortune. You never know when your turn of bad luck has actually saved you from an episode of worse luck. The most respected and successful people in this world have always had one or more hardships early in life. If you were to find someone who you thought had no hardship, upon questioning them, you'd likely learn they found discomfort in an area you may never have thought of, or may not even approve of, but it was definitely real for them.

## We Stand on the Shoulders of Giants

We speak languages we didn't invent, and travel on roads we didn't pave. So too are most of the thoughts we have handed down to us, without needing to invent them ourselves. Ism's and ity's give us paths to follow, and billions of people do. However, the number of available playbooks and perspectives of organizing the world into parts, and suggested actions on those parts, are quite few really. Philosophy, and communism, capitalism, Marxism, are all interesting ways to see the world, but ultimately not very useful to you, as they don't really answer the more important questions: What do *you* do? What can you do better to get what you want out of life?

Inside of all of us there is a circuitry, which has served our ancestors for thousands upon thousands of years. It is with you today because it works. Nature tends to get rid of things that don't work. Oddly, nature tends to get rid of everything over time. Scivive could expand on this using a whole series of books called “99 percent of everything that has ever existed is permanently extinct.” It's an amazing fact, really. But for now, focus on the circuitry.

As you come into the world, you are influenced from all angles. Those angles are not only external. They are internal to you as well, both mental and chemical. The influence of heredity, customs, location—it all leaves an imprint. When an American travels the world, people easily determine they are from America by the way that they speak. These observers may have preconceived notions about what it means to be American, how Americans act, and of what use they are. If you wanted to ask someone how to make great tea, you'd likely rather ask an Englishman as it's much more popular there. Conversely, if you wanted to know how to throw a forward pass in football, you'd be better off asking an American.

The influence of your parents, geographical location, language, skin color, education, natural abilities, and talents all play a role on how you turn out in life.

## Persistence

Here's an interesting lesson, arguably the most interesting one of all: Not all of those things combined, the entire mass of all of it, will ever compare to your *drive*. A highly driven person can overcome great adversity and sometimes even become a hero, despite any of the hardships or factors aforementioned.

There is a special place in our souls for the role of hero. When we see someone do something amazing, in the Olympics, on the battlefield, or at home, there's a calling to some part of us that wants to greatly reward them and rejoice, because they brought something into reality we've so often dreamt of. Even if not conscious, some part of us knows that what they did was great and we should smile and stand tall in admiration.

As it stands, a Scivivalist's favorite quote of all time could be from Calvin Coolidge:

> "Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan, ‘Press on!” has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."

Many people that haven't read *The Art of War* like to denounce it, because they think that everyone that reads it tries to turn everything else into war so the learning of the book can be applied. If people that read it are improperly applying it, then it may be the case. In reality, what you will find is that the conflicts that exist in war also exist outside of war. Just as Shakespeare might say something along the lines of "to thy own self be true," may be biblical as well. If you Google the phrase “Know thy enemy,” you will come up with *The Art of War*, written by Sun Tzu over 2,500 years ago. That phrase has been adapted through the centuries in countless works of literature. Originally the premise was in three parts:

1. If you know only thyself, with every battle you will also have a loss.
2. If you know the enemy but not thyself, you will also lose a fair amount of your battles.
3. If you know thyself and your enemy, you can fight a hundred battles without a loss.

Knowing yourself and your enemy does applies not only to conducting warfare. Knowing yourself can exist in all areas of life. You need knowledge of the other thing that which is the struggle you are pushing against, which might not be another conscious actor. It might be cold temperatures, it might be laziness, it might be cooking food properly. Such knowledge grants you huge a huge advantage against it. Every good story is pushed against some weight. Therefore the statement “Know thyself and thy enemy" is useful in all contexts, particularly those outside of war.

The reason the book has remained relevant for over twenty-five centuries isn't because we are all warriors and generals, it's because it's universally powerful advice in many areas that are not related to war. Conflict and strategy and effort are required in many important areas of life.

Maybe what's actually most important to you isn't the cool novel ideas included in Scivive that give it validity. Maybe what you need is the more basic stuff that influenced the author and the writing of this book. Perhaps those same basic ideas bring you to a position where you can build and give back. Don't be so in love with the concepts you built after you achieved, without paying homage to those that allowed you begin building in the first place. The precedent ideas of others are equally as important as your expansion on them. Don't allow the precedent generic useful ideas become forgotten because you internally value more all the “new to you,” or "generated by you" ideas.

## Every Path Gets Taken

Every path gets taken. People will follow all the paths, and advertise more good paths to outcompete the bad ones. When you understand the whole system, when you see the earth as a spinning blue marble, you can play in the game when you want, and you can also be satisfied with not playing the game, because you know what all the endings of the game look like. This is futility at its finest. All paths shall be followed, even fake ones you made up for fun, so spamming good ones is a great idea, and it's a contact sport.

## Preparing for the Apocalypse

Survivalists and doomsayers spend lots of time and money on things that rarely pay off. The survivalists of the 1950s prepared for a Russian nuke attack, and then got killed by the same boring stuff that killed most of their ancestors—cancer and heart attacks, mostly. You're much more likely to die with a whimper than a bang these days.

## Artful Beats Accurate

Artful beats accurate. It can be interesting when you decide to do things less accurately but end up with a better effect. For instance, *Scivive* includes “Spirit” as a section, although some may find it an inaccurate description. The way most people would understand spirit is as something that is beyond them, past them, deeper than them. It's beyond personality, it's beyond behavior. Scivive tends not to believe in that, but since everyone else does to such a great degree, it's useful to be inaccurate and use “spirit.” But this book is going to use it differently from the way that most people do. That is to say that “spirit” could be defined as the emotions and drives that compel you into action, which most people would probably put under “mind,” but it's close enough to the ephemeral and ghostlike that they'll probably also accept it under "spirit.”

Scivive made the decision to choose "feels good, is emotionally compelling and easier to digest” over “more accurate, alien, off-putting, and less likely to execute and do.” It was a logical decision. If you must choose between “accuracy” and “feels good,” and the “feels good” is about 80% as accurate as the super-accurate, you should definitely go with the “feels good” because in the grand scheme of things, these are not recipes that will be followed to the letter. People will only perform a very small—less than 1% subset—of the self-help advice that you provide to them.

If you make a small adjustment for the sake of being able to remember, transmit, or be sticky or feel better about it, or address or synchronize with a common parable that people believe in, such as “there's no free lunch” or “time heals all wounds”—euphemisms like that—then you're better off doing it, because people are unlikely to execute the specific thing that you weren't 100% accurate on. Therefore, the things that they're more likely to execute on are the stuff you're enhancing by not alienating with unspecific language or overly specific language that has no heart and no feel, and stops them and makes them think for a long time instead of just continuing the digestion train, the “yes” train, the rapport. Breaking rapport for no good reason is a bad strategy.

If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough. Simplicity is power.

## Notes on Self-Help Books

It is very likely that most people haven't completed reading any self-help material, let alone most of the classics in it, so let's not just assume they are where you are, and that they don't need to know what you already take for granted. Most people don't follow their own advice, let alone what they read in literature. If this book simply said, “eat healthy, brush your teeth, and exercise," (which is great advice), no one would read it.

People want to read something they have not already heard a million times. The ideas that you have to hear about are novel, unique, outrageous, and thus make a book worth reading.

The most important part of writing a book isn't to present all the data you have on a thing, but to invoke the reader, and give them a better ability to analyze that data further, and dig deeper. In an ideal world, where one has a ton of memory and an Internet connection, they already have access to everything in the world. What they need from you is less, not more. They don't need more data, they need better data. You need to refine and hone their limited attention span on something that is truly beneficial to them, rather than illustrating a million things to confuse the issue. Bruce Lee said, “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” Again, simplicity is power if practiced and focused properly.

## Get More Out of This Book

Demand results from your study of this work. Get more out of the book, maintain an open mind, and focus on results. Demand results from your study of this work. Scivive is only as good as the actions you take from it, and, by proxy, the actions others may take from it from the ideas passing through you. If a book told you to follow a set of instructions without providing convincing proof, would it be a useful book? No. Demand more from your life. Low expectations are the father of regret. If all your dreams came true instantly, what would your life look like? Specifically, set a new standard. Dream the dream. Live the dream. In this world, you're either making your dreams come true, or you are a part of someone else's.

## Time Is Precious

You're only awake 16 hours a day. Now subtract out all the hours where you have to be doing something. How many hours are left? Three? This is your free time. Choose wisely how you spend these precious few hours.

If your schedule hasn't changed when you finish *Scivive*, read it again, because you're only going to get the improvement you want in your life when it's scheduled full of more action.

You never step in the same river twice. It changes, and over time, so do you. When you read with a result in mind, you notice and remember the parts that are most important for you to remember. Scivive offers something different to each person who reads it. Everyone is at a different place in their personal journey. As you progress, you'll see that it adds new meaning to parts that didn't seem so special to you the first time around.

A real conversation is the highest aspiration of a well-written book. Most books are nothing like a conversation. In a conversation of equals, you listen at least as much as you speak. The dazed look on one of your audience's faces easily lets you know when you need to spend more time explaining something. Sometimes you can feel what's going on inside your conversational partner's mind. You notice when a person's mouth is eager and waiting for a pause, any pause will do, to add to the conversation. A conversation where everyone is learning and building is a beautiful thing. *Scivive* is a mere two dimensional representation of such a glorious event, and three dimensions are much better as they add a great deal of complexity, interaction, and exploration of a subject.

If what you have to say is important enough to make into a book, then it is surely important enough to be written in a language your audience understands. If you want to have a good time speaking with teenagers, the elderly, hippies, and CEOs, you'd better learn to speak a few different languages. It is believed that if you speak to a person as a friend, and are interested in similar things, you can form a greater and longer lasting bond.

Since a book cannot converse with you directly to ask you personally about the things you care about, *Scivive* is going to have to settle for you choosing your own adventure. You can leave the parts of this conversation that are least important to you for last. The topics covered in *Scivive* are broad and touch so many people in many places that they can be seen from hundreds of perspectives. Where one person finds an idea exciting, another will be enraged. What could be more fun!

## An Open Mind Welcomes Controversy

We deal in controversial things, for those are the things that have the most profit. The more people that are doing a thing wrong, the more profit there is in changing to doing it right. Sadly, people doing things wrong usually think they're doing them right, and perhaps better than everyone else. Telling people what they're doing wrong, and how to do it better, usually pisses them off.

Find freedom by not becoming the devil's advocate.

Don't be a slave to someone else's position.

We're lucky when we meet someone who is not only passionate about that which they speak but perhaps even knowledgeable as well. We would obviously want to impress such a person speaking to us, so as to be worthy of the conversation. What are the most common ways you've seen this happen yourself? You can't very well repeat back the same ideas that were just given to you. You might come up with a novel idea that could add to another's; however that person is likely more knowledgeable and has been thinking about it for longer, which may be why the topic was brought up in the first place. It would be most impressive if you could construct on top of another person's idea and make it stronger.

There is an easy way, though, and a shortcut to feeling important: Destruction! Let the idea maker know why it is wrong, why it won't work, or shouldn't work, or can't work. This is great stuff, where in the original conversation, if you only added a small icing on the idea cake, you'd seem only to be an accessory. If instead you disagree with someone's ideas, you are equal or greater! Screw the quest for truth, which pays off only after many days. Feeling important pays off right now! Think about the last time you tried to explain to someone they were doing something wrong, and remember the mental gymnastics you might have witnessed. It takes a great person to skip the easy route and bide their time in silence, thinking of something great to add. When the gambit pays off, and you can construct with your speaking buddy instead of disagreeing, friendships are made.

## A Multiplicity of Perspectives

There are many different ways to make a judgment about something.

For example, when some people are driving, they absolutely hate cyclists on the road. When a bicycle is so damn close to the car's side view mirror that it looks like they'll collide—how stressful! Bikes are the enemy. They are yet another opportunity to ruin a life, and if this flimsy human is nudged with the car, he'll likely sprawl into a broken heap, and the driver will spend much quality time in prison.

From the bicycler's perspective, why would someone waste money on a car, and fuel, and car insurance, when people need to exercise for health anyway? Why not help the environment, save money from the wallet, and improve one's heart by bicycling to work! If a cyclist runs over a pedestrian with the bike instead of a car, it is likely there will be no fatalities or jail time involved.

If two people have two different perspectives, which one is right? Perhaps both people, at different times. Or even at the same time. These kinds of very hard to square, wars of perspective, are happening all the time. Imagine how much easier it is to find disagreement instead of construction on ideas.

We humans are very good at not understanding things when we don't want to. There are two old sayings that encompass the idea pretty well:

1. You cannot wake a man who's pretending to sleep. — Navajo Indian proverb.
2. It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it. — Upton Sinclair.

Why must this be mentioned? Sometimes, we are that person. Anyone who has ever changed his or her mind about something was likely not happy to hear someone disagreeing from the start of the conversation. Once we've changed our mind about something, we quickly forget how strongly we previously believed the other direction. No one likes to think that they were ever wrong, and likely even less, that they'll be wrong again sometime soon.

You're going to get the most out of this book, and life, if you find ways to squeeze the knowledge out where it's useful, and focus on learning and becoming more powerful at the expense of the bravado of disagreement. If the need for disagreement becomes too hard to bear, boot up good old YouTube, and comment your anger away, as mostly everyone else does these days.

Are you the type of person who is good at learning new things? What is the maximum amount that you can agree with what Scivive is saying? Think about how much you have actually used or changed based on all the books you have read in your life. Do you think that you should get more out of them? What could you do to get the most out of *Scivive* for yourself?

In the pages ahead, secrets are revealed and many questions answered. There is only you and these great ideas. Your life is in your hands. Don't waste a moment—seize the future and make it work for you.

MIND
Knowing Vs. Doing
You do less than you could, and know more than you need. What happens to those who
exercise and eat well? They become fit. Are you fit? If you’re unfit, is it due to a lack of
knowledge? Any exercise works, any diet works. Eat less, move more. It’s certainly not the
knowledge that is the problem. Millions of people choose to learn instead of do, and they die
quite unaccomplished and smart. This is the quiet desperation of the intelligent. Be smart, even
wise; but only as a means, not an end. Knowing isn’t doing and knowledge isn’t action. What
you need isn’t more know-how, but more desire. If the world were to transform to one where
everyone did what they thought they should, then it’d need more know-how. While you live in a
world where almost no one does all the things they think they should, you have more a discipline
problem than a knowledge problem. Would you rather have your cake, or eat it? There’s a
similar challenge choosing between knowing how to do something, and actually doing it.
They’re related, but quite different in practice. That’s why great sports players learn from
coaches that can’t play better than the players. Knowing and doing are different, yet related.
Grow your mind with action as a guide. Adding to the list of things you know you should do, but
do not, is pain. The value of knowledge comes only from application.

Language and Input
What languages you should speak
Speak a single language
If it’s better to say new better things in a single language, then the same limited things in
several language.
Learn these language
Learn the language you need.

Learn the language of business (Warren Buffet’s advice) (accounting).
Learn the language of scalability (programming).
Learn the language of entrepreneurship (influence).
Stop Breaking Words
Stop breaking all the words! Do not call everything rape and everything racism, and destroy
the usefulness and uniqueness and power of those words! Perception, attention, lens, focus, and
paradigm are all words that should be used properly.
Perception, attention, lenses, focus, paradigm
Focus control and attention economy; have high standards for what you pay attention to!

Information Overload
Back in the old days, it was very hard to find information. Now it’s too easy to find
information. We went from having to meet with people physically, to being able to speak to them
over a distance on the phone, to email, to texting, and now you rarely need to speak to the person
to ask them a question because we have Wikipedia, YouTube videos, blogs, and Twitter. We are
drowning in content. There is lots more signal to be had, and there’s lots more noise, too. Since
the signal is always lower in quantity than the noise, if you have good standards for what you
should be paying attention to, it’s not distraction, clickbait, and social proof.
Every day that passes the amount of bad content and wrong ideas is created more and faster
and more convincingly than good content and right ideas. Since they put less time into building
good ideas, they have extra time to figure out how to sell the bad ideas better. Now that’s a
tragedy. Those with the best ideas are too busy building them to market them. Marketing of ideas
and building of ideas are wildly different, except in one area, the building of marketing /
communication / influence ideas. It’s self-referential and amplifying. All the other ideas aren’t.

Lens of Scivivalism: Focus on the Positive
Don’t focus on the negativity; what you look at affects how you feel. If you grew up around
people that are negative and what you learn is negative behaviors, then you end up being
negative yourself with a higher likelihood. If you focus only on the negative aspects of the world,

that will rub off on you to some degree and you will feel it constantly and disperse it further. At
any given moment there’s an infinite amount of good and bad things going on, and the feelings
that you will feel and your perception of the world will be what you focus on.
A good shortcut for understanding that by imagining yourself as a crystal, either a cool-
looking shard of crystal or crystal figurine that your eyes would accept the light of what you
looked at. If you tuned into and looked at a pretty light that was beautiful, say a white light or a
blue light, that’s what you would radiate, that’s what you would feel when other people look at
you. They would see the light that you are focusing on. If there was some other negative thing
going on in the world and that is what you focused on, then that is what you would feel and you
wouldn’t just feel it, you would also re-transmit it, radiate it and become that color. Therefore,
you become what you focus on and you become good at what you do. You appear to others to be
what it is that you focus on and what it is that you do.

Thus, that analogy of the energy of what you look at changing your body, is really well
transmitted by the light and crystal analogy. Additionally, when you think about the way that a
prism divides a white light into its separate colors and wavelengths, and that if you were to re-
combine those colors and wavelengths once again, you would get white light on the other side.
That’s balanced. As soon as you remove one of those wavelengths, you no longer are able to
recreate white light again, because you’re missing one of the components you need.

Positive Phrasing
The lesson here could be, don’t focus on problems, instead rephrase in a positive light. If you
focus on problems, you only get more problems.
Positive Rephrasing is important: Focus on what you don’t want only for a short time.
Which do you think is a shorter path to fitness, understanding losing, or understanding winning?
Positive phrasing is super important. If you want to be fit, focus on fitness. You’re going to hear
this theme a lot. Focus on what you don’t want literally only as long as it takes to invert it, and
create the positive understanding and language of what you DO want. Maybe someone tells you
to not imagine a giant neon pink elephant right now, drinking some chocolate milk. Did you not
imagine it? If you think about not being fat, you’ll actually think about being fat and eating
fattening foods. If you take the time to invert it, and you think about being fit, you’ve made your

life so very, very much easier, simply by changing the suggestive posturing of the thought. This
new stance will affect your decision making process subconsciously, and a percentage of the
work (needed to become fit) has already been done for you.

Understanding Your Perception Through Senses
Understanding your perception through senses in important. Not only are you different
from how you used to be, your vision changes, your taste changes, but you will become different
from how you currently are, too. To explain, for instance, music; there’s something called the
Fletcher-Munson curves, which means that your hearing changes entirely based on how loud or
not loud a sound is. For instance, it is widely accepted that you should master music with a
reference volume of 75 to 85 dB SPL because that’s where hearing is most linear.
Thus, unless you have a calibrated decibel meter with you, it’s very hard to tell just by
listening how loud a sound actually is. This means that without you realizing, your hearing itself
changes its perception based on how loud or soft a sound is. It wouldn’t be surprising if similar
kinds of changes based on brightness existed for your visual perception as well.
As far as knowing what the real world looks like, we’re stuck in a pretty funny spot - we
not only have all these glossy perceptions, but our brains also are susceptible to shortcuts that
make us more effective some of the time, of being less effective other times. For instance, you
always see your nose, it’s always there, but you just never notice it, and the same thing goes for
blinking. You never really notice your eyes blinking, even though it’s literally making you blind
in both eyes for a brief moment.
Then there are things like infrared, which we can’t see, but machines and animals can. This
means that they can actually see temperature. There are even animals that can see polarized light,
which helps them hunt, and although undetectable to human eyes without the aid of some device,
it helps us recover erased and hidden writing in ancient documents or evidence in crime scenes.
Point being, if current you is so different from past you, and current you will hear the different
sounds in the same song differently based on whether it’s a little louder or a little less loud, then
how the hell could one expect another human being, in their past or present, to detect the real
world similarly to how you view it?
You can avoid lots of arguments by just understanding that when you see dark blue and
someone else sees blue, it might be they chose to deploy the words differently, or it could be

that they really do see the color differently, and are judging it the same, but off a different input
value to their brain.
Some individuals know that one of their eyes sees sharper than the others, and know that they
each see color slightly differently, perhaps in that one is a more red tint and one is a more blue
tint, or as they’d say in the color correcting business, one is warmer and one is cooler. (Right
now you are closing each eye and looking at different colors around the room, aren’t you?)
This also applies to people that color calibrate photos, monitors, display devices, movies and
films. They adjust their brightness to a reference level, usually 120 cd/m, but as you learned
earlier, it’s very hard to know what that light level actually equals to in others’ brains. Some
standard, however, is better than no standard. Standards are the language that the world speaks
in, that makes interoperability and communication possible. You could say standards are the
cooperative language of non-humans.
Thus, know that your perception of the world is probably very different than everyone else’s,
sometimes for good reasons, and sometimes for not so good reasons. Therefore, you shouldn’t
waste too much time arguing over perception if you can avoid it. You can use some tricks to
figure out how a person’s perception actually works, for them. That’s how we build vision
correcting lenses for contacts and Seeing Eye glasses. We can look at their eye and make a pretty
good guess based on the shape to measure what kind of lens they will need to make their vision
better. It’s not always perfect though, so what many people end up doing for better results is
testing a whole bunch of different lenses and answering the question, “which is better, this, or
this?”
Now even that is a funny experience as well, because once again, people don’t understand the
decisions that are being made. Based on how you change the red and green color questions, you
will affect your color perception. Because if you’re correcting for astigmatism, you have to
choose a middle ground of correction, you can’t perfectly correct both the wavelengths with the
same glass. You affect how you see vertical and horizontal lines differently, then on top of all of
that, the lens works better when it’s smaller, closer to the eye, and made of a glass that has a
higher abbe value. How many people know that their vision correcting glasses made all these
tradeoffs, and that they can have better and worse color and contrast perception based on the
material and coatings that their lenses have? What a complex world we have created, in attempt to
equalize perception as best we can amongst different people. What we think we perceive is so

very often not what we actually perceive. It is hard to make good decisions when you have bad
data.

Set Your Brain for Well-Roundedness
If you have your brain set for well-roundedness and you’re able to execute pretty awesomely
in all areas, it’s also very likely that you’re not going to be an idiot savant. It’s very likely that
it’s going to be harder for you to produce levels of excellence intellectually in a very advanced
intellectual field in regards to those people that don’t have the overhead of an honest and good
life and a brain that works well socially. Social understanding and social excellence is actually
quite advanced.
Vision and Colors
You can make people think your website is loading faster than it really is by changing its
color:
https://www.jstor.org/stable/30162328?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents
Our eyes evolved to sense the natural environment that’s most useful to us, what’s trying to
eat us, and what we are trying to eat. This is why we see greens better than blues, and why much
of our visual attention is based on movement. Much more of the land we live on and eat from is
green. As a matter of fact, we see blue so poorly, they often encode less of it in our videos, and
display it using less pixels, because we see it with such lower resolution. Of our 6 to 7 million
cones, we’ve got 64% “red” cones, 32% “green” and , only 2% “blue.”
From <http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/rodcone.html>
Different vantage points can give you an edge. Birds move their heads around, to see more
of the world, like a sampling rate, and so we have emotions which cause us to move our heads
around as well, like blurriness causes us to squint.
(this is spirtual understanding regarding emotional programming, and how you can better
influence others.) Why are some color combinations pretty?
We didn’t just evolve physically to see different colors better than others, we also evolved to
prefer certain colors in combination with other colors. Some colors look great together, and some
look very bad together.
[GRAPHICS OF COLORS]
Vs
If a color combination is only activating one of our three cones, it would make sense for us to
respond emotionally and try and change our vantage point to see if we could get more light, or a
better perspective on what we were looking at to engage the other cones. In some cases,
poisonous creatures have also chosen red and yellow to signify that they are poisonous, and are
capable enough to harm or kill you.
There’s a fancy name for colorful warnings in animals:
Aposematism
From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism

Mutants exist!
Interestingly, a very small group of people have 4! (See tetrachromacy)
If you take a look at the color wheel, many of the prettiest combinations are at opposite
sides of the color wheel. That’s because they engage more of the eye. We prefer color
combinations that are on opposites of each other on the color wheel because they provide
maximum contrast, and engage the most color sensing cones in our eyes. The reason our brains
naturally care about colors that are on opposite ends of the color spectrum, is because we know
that we have the best idea of seeing what’s there because there’s no other contrast that can show
an edge because the edges are already shown by the maximum contrast.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism

Knowledge and Action
We need more whys. Because if you don’t have a good “why,” you shouldn’t be teaching that
shit. If you can’t teach a kid why something is important, it’s actually not important. You should
stop teaching it. It’s amazing how little we know, like what’s on the other side of the wall from
where you are right now? Does it even matter? How important would it be to acquire that extra

bit of knowledge? Well, it depends on your task. Are you tearing down the wall or making a
penetration for a wire? Your task at hand is what determines the “Why.”
Smart pays better
http://www.samuelwbennett.com/college-academic-performance-and-future-earnings/
Education
We don’t need smarter losers; we need stupider ass-kickers. We need to trade education for
motivation. If it’s true that the world doesn’t have a knowledge problem, it has a doing shit
problem, then isn’t it funny that what everyone values is a college education which only makes
you smarter, not more effective, not more productive, not hungrier, not with higher standards,
just smarter. We don’t need smarter people; we need people that use more of what they already
know.

Economy of Learning: Know the Minimum
There is an economy of learning, in that you should only learn the minimum you need to learn
to get the job done. The things you need to know to get a good thing done is going to be a very
small set of all the things you could possibly know. That means that you’re almost always better
of restricting what you learn to what you actually need to know for something you’re doing, than
you are trying to overlearn and hope that there’s a good collision between what you learned, and
what you actually needed to learn. If you knew how many doctors used Google to search for
your symptoms, you’d understand that even overtraining doesn’t keep you from still having to
learn specifically about the problem currently at hand. Overtraining is the enemy in a fast
moving world. You will usually learn much more from applying what you’ve learned in the real
world than just reading about it anyway.
Knowing facts doesn’t mean you’re intelligent
Knowing facts doesn’t mean you’re intelligent. What you know, and your ability to use what
you know are only loosely related. This means you could learn lots of facts and have no idea
what to do with them, or you could be super intelligent, but not know enough about the real
world to find any good method to apply that power.

Car-Mind Analogy
Knowing this is the fuel for your engine. Intelligence is your engine. Just as a real engine
compresses and ignites fuel to create motion, heat, and power, so too does your mind smash
together ideas to create new and better ideas and actions. Knowledge is what you know.
Intelligence is how well you can understand and manipulate what know. You can increase either
of them; however, you’ll find that knowledge is greatly easier to increase than intelligence. It’s
easier to walk for longer than it is to run faster. You can always walk twice as long, at some
point you can’t run twice as fast.
Know thyself. Are you the light or the dark?
Know thyself. Are you the light or the dark? If you can’t get better answers to hard questions
than others, then you probably shouldn’t be influencing others. You’re not the light shining in
the dark; you’re just more of the dark. If you want to get things right where everyone else gets
them wrong, then it’s really handy to know what common things most people screw up so you
can avoid those traps yourself. Understanding what you know, and what you do not know, is just
as important of knowing anything in the first place.
Knowing what you know
Just smart enough to be dangerous

The Uncanny Valley of True Knowledge
When you don’t know how complicated the world is, and you present simple solutions for
complex problems, you get to discover, the hard way, why those solutions were bad ideas. If you
think the world is a simple place, and you understand that simplicity, then you have the
contentment that can come with ignorance.
The uncanny valley of true knowledge - If you realize the world is a complicated place, you
can become fearful and worried that you don’t understand it well enough, even though you’re
better equipped to perform in it than the content and ignorant man. That is the uncanny valley of
understanding the world.

Simpler Ideas Are More Useful
Simpler ideas are often more useful – It seems like the smartest people feel obligated to read
things that they feel are at the edge of their understanding, so they can feel like they’re growing.

The problem is that if you’re one of the smartest people, that shit at the edge of your
understanding isn’t really useful to most other people. It’s quite often that people stupider than
the smartest are much more useful to the general public, because the shit that they study is within
the realm of understanding of the common folk.

Knowledge Is Asymmetrical
Knowledge asymmetry example
At night the person on the dark side of the window can see the other side fine. The person on
the brighter side, however, can’t see through. When you’re dealing with noise, the person closer
to the loud side can’t hear anything, but the person on the quiet inside can hear just fine. That’s
why if you’re in the attic working, no one can hear you, but you can hear everybody. When
you’re in the shower, you can’t hear anything but everyone can hear you.
Isn’t it cool that there’s a strong and weak position for light, sound, and actual knowledge? It
would be great to always know whether you were on the weak or strong side, before you started
making decisions, for instance trading a market, or negotiating sales and purchases, or writing
contracts.
Learning tricks
Peak state and staying engaged while learning
Motion is emotion

Peak State Practice and Tony Robbins’ “Date with Destiny”..............................................
One of the best events or seminars that you can attend in the world is Anthony Robbins’
“Date with Destiny”. It’s expensive, about five thousand dollars, it happens over approx. five
days, and they don’t tell you this when you sign up, but those five days are going to be 16 hour
days. Now, you may ask yourself, how on earth do you keep a bunch of rather old, rather plump
executives and other types, that have five grand to blow on a seminar a couple times a year, and
very specific places that you have to travel to and pay for your accommodation, how do you get
those people to stay engaged and learning and happy about the experience for 16 hours? The
solution is, depending on how you want to frame it, really, really awesome and amazing, because
it works, or rather disappointing, because it’s so goddamn simple that you would think that it

shouldn’t work. Basically, the magic is, you stand up, you jump up and down for joy, and are
genuinely happy and dance to fancy music and massage the people around you, and do shit that
seems totally alien in the muted, static, non-moving world that we’re used to these days.
If you were to look back into when you were younger, when you were a kid, or, if you see
kids in the mall; you were running, kids now are running. One is not sure at what age the running
stops, but the kids love to run, and climb, and jump, and search, and then sometime between then
and when you’re older, that shit dies and we get scared, and we’re like “No, I don’t want to act
any different, people might notice me.”
So, does it work? It does, one hundred percent. Do you want to actually do it to demonstrate
it? No, because you are not used to doing it, but you’re going to, because in this life you only get
the results of that what you will actually do, knowing about things doesn’t matter so much, doing
the shit matters much more unless you’re so very lucky to be a coach or someone that can
influence the world through mass media. If it’s anything that you or the people that you interact
with is actually going to benefit from, it is very, very, very likely that it is something that you’re
actually going to need to do, rather than know about.

Learning Through Games
Chess
Being good at chess has very little value outside of chess. Knowing to cut off escapes before
you move in for the kill, leave options open with forks, value tempo and position, know that
some things can be sacrificed for position or speed, and realizing that different tools excel at
different things. That’s about it, and that is being generous. Those lessons aren’t even obvious,
and you might never learn them without just being straight up told them. Learning logic is much,
much better than learning chess.

From <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dItUGF8GdTw>
Information Sources
Be careful who you take advice from
It’s funny, if you ever learned neuro-linguistic programming, NLP, one of the cofounders of
the system is Richard Bandler, and Richard Bandler has been fat for as long as that system has
existed. Richard has been known to be a smoker, and is a bit overweight. Maybe he kicked the
smoking, but he has spent a lifetime fat though. To the intelligent person, you have to be careful
to take investment advice and life advice from homeless people, and you have to be careful in
taking personal development advice from people who are fat and smoke, and have done so for a
very long time, yet advertise they have the cures to these very things, and that the cures are fast,
painless and take nearly no effort on your part to execute. If that was the case, then why wouldn’t
the person or a partner have accidentally cured them of that obviously stupid shit by now?

Forums—Calling out Idiots
Every time you see two people disagreeing on TV, if you wait a few years, and revisit the
footage, you can probably tell which one of them was a dumb ass and wrong. It would be fun if
similar to a justice porn channel, there was a “look how wrong this dumb ass was” channel..
Commencement speeches and final speeches
Commencement speeches are both time-limited and optimized to benefit the listener with
actionable useful advice. Final speeches are time-limited and are optimized for speaking about a
thing so important it’s the last thing people want.
Votes and picks don’t count, unless they come at a cost
Horse pickers
Pick horses at random, send lots of the predictions, watch when the guy that randomly got 4
picks right in a row sent to him thinks you’re awesome. Otherwise people can vote on all
possibilities and look right all the time.
Speed up videos and audio
Try watching videos and audio at 1.5x speed if you can understand that fast. Understanding is
all that matters. If you need more time, slow it down.

The Unbearable Asymmetry of Bullshit
http://quillette.com/2016/02/15/the-unbearable-asymmetry-of-bullshit/
What is knowledge? Know the right things
The usefulness of knowing the difference between intelligence and knowledge is mostly to get
you to stop wasting your time and focus on things that matter instead of sitting out thinking
you’re smart, while you’re beating your peers at all the wrong things. You know sports better
than your friend? You have failed. Are you better at last year’s video game that no one plays
anymore? You have failed. You have put thousands of hours into Donkey Kong to be the king of
Kong? Congratulations, you’re are the biggest fish in the smallest toilet bowl.

Difference Between Intelligence and Knowledge................................................................
When looking at the mind, one way to understand the difference between Intelligence and
knowledge is the way a computer does. You have a CPU that does all the processing, that’s why
it’s called the central processing unit. It’s only as useful as your ability to feed it work to process.
Knowledge is your memory, your gained wisdom, and much like your computer has long-term
and short-term memory (hard drives are long-term and ram is short-term.) A computer with no
memory is pretty useless. A very intelligent person deprived of things to learn is equally tragic.

Eponymous Laws - Build on the Communication of Great Ideas
Modern discoveries are often named after those who popularized an idea. Back when our
understanding of the world was much less accurate, some individuals made such great
contributions of so many ideas that have never been seen, that you couldn’t name any one thing
they came up with as “their name’s law”, because they had a bunch of other great discoveries as
well. These days, it is rather rare that more than a couple of laws are named after any given
person. This is partly because it’s harder now than ever before to make tons of contributions, for
the same reason it’s easier to make a single one, information sharing. Back then if you were
working on a hard problem, you might very well be the only person on the planet doing so, for
communication was slow and inefficient. Now the same communication that brings you great
ideas to build on, is the same communication that creates a leveling effect against your ability to
massively produce ideas in series without someone else “stealing your thunder” and making
great progress on what you’ve made known.
This is better for the world in a lot of ways. First, we all build on the backs of giants, and
so must we offer the improved ideas we build to those that come after us to stand on as well. It’s
easier to remember these laws, because they all have unique names. How easy is it to remember
the Streisand effect, when you know the story of her trying to remove pictures of her house from
the Internet, which angered the Internet, and when the Internet is angry, spreading data is what it
does best. Needless to say, what few people would ever care to know about became quite
important, for only the fact she wanted it hidden. It’s insanely likely that the idea of drawing
unwanted attention to a small thing by trying to hide it and getting caught was well known long
before the Barbara Streisand incident, however, it was never so easy to remember previously..
That’s what’s great about a law. Ideas are only as useful to us as we remember that they
even exist, and when they should be used. It’s even better if you know how to use them
accurately. Knowing is half the battle, they say, and again, knowledge placed into action is
considerably more important.
Some of these laws are really interesting. If you hope to add to the world’s understanding
of complicated things, you too should hope to phrase an understanding so well, that it becomes a
law named after you. This idea of naming things after inventors applies in more places than just
ideas.

The Only Useful Knowledge Is Practical Knowledge
If paying attention to what works in the world that we live in is an effective strategy for
discovering what works, which is tautological, the important educational point there is that by
seeing what works for other creatures and in nature, you can kind of extend that discovery into
other areas. If you see in the animal kingdom that strength gets chosen a lot more often than
weakness, it could be very likely that in your life, and in most other people’s lives, displaying
strength pays off a lot better than displaying weakness. The point here is that by understanding
some parts of life, no matter what they are, if you’re intelligent, you can usually learn something
unexpected about other parts of life, because lots of things in life are related.
Acquisition: How, when, why, where
Mission should not be to get the best of logic
You see all these super smart super logical people that disagree about things. If they disagree
about things, that means one of them is wrong, which means that one of those two super genius,
super smart, super logical people is horribly wrong. In this case, the other one’s right, or, they’re
both wrong. It is possible, though very unlikely, that they have misread the question and they’re
both right. Your mission in life shouldn’t be to get the best of logic unless you want to add to the
science or teach people logic. If you want to lead a good and wholesome life, you don’t actually
need that much. The logic you need isn’t that complicated. It seems like if you go farther into
that rabbit hole and farther into the complicating anything that you might learn, you won’t be
able to benefit from, because you don’t have the horsepower and the time to properly apply it
and know when to apply it.
If you spend all day building tools instead of using tools, you’re a good tool builder. It doesn’t
mean that you’re good at using the tools.
Scivive doesn’t want you to believe that getting smarter is the best thing that you can do. You
should not believe that understanding logic the best is the best thing you can do. This is evident
when looking at the past of all the other human beings that have ever existed, those that you
would be most likely to trade places with, if you could be convinced to do so, or those that you

respect the most, are almost never the best at the thing that they did. They might be quite good,
they might be top ten percent, top two percent, but they’re almost never the best, because to truly
be the best at a thing, you’ve got to make a load of sacrifices in other places in your life and
endure pain to overly push out in that one singular direction and singular focus.
You probably only see the upside and not all the sacrifice, pain, sleepless nights and lost
friendships, because it’s not well marketed to you and no one is making any money selling you
that idea.

Your perception of how fun, pleasurable and what you get out of other ways of living than the
way that you currently have, is heavily weighted towards it being a lot better than it really is. No
one finds profit in telling you the truth that everyone that has done a hard thing that other people
have tried and failed. Knowing that being the smartest and the most logical is not your aim, it’s
not your goal and that you’ll probably endure a lot of pain from not being well rounded. Both
success and failure leave clues. If you attempt the same things that others have tried and failed,
you’re also likely to fail. If you do things that winners do, you’re likely to win. Highest and best
behavior is hard to measure because best is very subjective. What’s the best color for instance?
Judging highest is much easier than judging best. When everyone learns the same shit, it
becomes valueless.
We have an entire culture of people going massively in debt to waste their time learning
things they can never use. Because the value of knowledge is indirectly proportional to its
availability, and since everyone’s learning the same shit, it’s all infinitely valueless. It’s the same
reason you can’t make money as a photographer because people do it for free. It’s hard to make
money as a musician because people do it for free. If you want to make money in this world,
you’ve got to do what other people don’t want to do and can’t do, so they’re willing to up the
ante and pay you a little bit more to do it. Learning what everyone else does, thus by definition
of value, the least scarce knowledge is therefore the least valuable.
Richard Feynman had a great talk on this in regards to a conversation that he had with his
father. They were in the Boy Scouts and they would go off into the mountains and hike alone,
and the other boys wanted to come along because his father was such a great person to talk to,
learn from and be educated by. He was a well-rounded thinker, and he really valued his alone
time with his son and wanted it to be more personal, more of a family thing. While the other kids

would go out to the woods and learn what all the birds were called, Richard Feynman’s father
said that what that bird is called is the least important thing about the bird. Let’s learn everything
else other than what the bird is called, because we could learn what that bird is called in ten or
fifteen different languages. After you know the fifteen different names for the bird, you now
know nothing about the bird. What does it eat? Why does it make the sounds that it makes?
Where does it travel? Is there an altitude that it likes? How long does it live? How educated is it?
Can you make it smarter? Everything that is useful to know about the bird is basically outside the
set of names that it’s called.
Do what Google can’t. Things you know that you aren’t using, replace with synthesis and
higher level understanding. If you want to be a crazy Google, please instead learn to do what
Google cannot. Being good at Google is better than memory. Memory tricks are the easiest to
teach and learn, unfortunately having a great memory is pretty useless these days. Being good at
googling is better than having a great memory. The crappiest pencil is better than the best
memory.

The Quantity and Quality of Information in Decision Making............................................
There should be a word for not learning about the difference between things and comparing
the ratio of the range of variants and the quality that can be obtained if you have extra
information, versus the range of time that you can spend learning about making that decision
properly. If someone hasn’t invented that concept of that idea, one should. The decision is to
whether you should continue to inquire information or not is the range of quality divided by the
range of time that it would take to learn to get the quality.
Ultimate Knowledge of a thing sometimes defeats the purpose of the thing
In life, some things need to be kept secret to work. If you go to see a comedy show, they don’t
tell you how they design the joke and how the joke has evolved over time, which versions of it
didn’t work and which timings of delivery worked, what kind of response you are waiting for
from the audience before you go to this thing. If they told you, any of that shit it wouldn’t be
funny. Ultimate knowledge of a thing sometimes defeats the purpose of the thing. It’s like
watching a film after you’ve studied filmmaking; you can never see films the same again
because you are always looking to the motives and intentions of the director. The same is true for
watching magicians, the moment you know the secret; you are no longer interested in the trick.

Having just enough knowledge to be dangerous - being a dilettante
Now, you can just use that knowledge to support whatever you were going to support anyway.
You should get better sleep because of serotonin reuptake, or aliens, or vibrations, and crystals,
and global feeling stuff. It’s literally appeal to ignorance. However, you don’t know you’re
ignorant, which makes it a different thing. Knowing enough to be dangerous is how people get
electrocuted replacing their blown fuses with aluminum bars, or destroying their computers with
registry editor.
The good news is that people misunderstand most things. How long does it take to brake
when you’re going extremely fast on the highway? Or how hard it is to turn a motorcycle when
you’re going extremely fast and when you start braking? You can’t turn anymore because it
brings the bike upright. You don’t realize those things until you’re already in danger. You don’t
realize that you should not be messing around in your electrical panel until you’re already dying.
It’s good that the rest of the world isn’t that way. Maybe you take too much Vitamin B, maybe
you get a headache or something, but take aspirin. You are now dangerous to yourself if you
don’t realize that taking too much aspirin literally kills you. You might be the kind of guy that
thinks that there’s not a minimum effective dose, more is always better and doesn’t understand
how medicine works or doesn’t understand how the human body works. As a result, now you’re
in the hospital, fighting for your life because you had a really bad headache. You thought just a
couple more Aspirin would finally kick in, finally cure it. Now you’re dying.
The likelihood that you will benefit from knowing a little bit about a thing and that ending
up doing more harm than good is directly proportional to the complexity of the thing that you’re
talking about. The more complex and hard to understand that thing is, the more likely you are to
mess it up and get harm instead of benefit. Knowing enough to be dangerous really exists in the
real world. You can know whether you’re getting more likely to get usefulness or more likely to
get pain. Out of a layman’s understanding of a thing, based on the complexity of the thing, you
should probably shut up about super complicated things of which you might have saw one
episode on the Discovery Channel. This why we have all seen some task or action, quickly
followed by the disclaiming warning, “Don’t try this at home, folks”.

Use Knowledge to Take Action
Who becomes more fit? The man who fills his days reading books on weightlifting and diet,
or the man who reads no such books, but never misses a morning round of pushups, pull-ups and
squats? Learning about fitness is not fitness. Learning about dance is not dancing. Learning
about success is not success. Unless you are a teacher or author, learning is only as useful as it
turns into action.

Learning by Doing Vs. Being Taught
Different tasks are better learned, or perfected, using different learning methods. One
implication here is that there are things that you can learn from doing, (actually going through
the motions over and over) and that’s totally useful, but there are some things that you can learn
best only through teaching, or being taught.
Know the difference between the method and the reason
Is what you think you want what you really want, or should want? Could you want something
better? Know the difference between a means and an end. Don’t confuse means for ends. Means
is another word for method, or way. For instance, if you wanted to know what you should eat,
most people would be far better off searching for healthy tasty food, instead of “Why am I fat?”
How to widen your understanding
There was a saying regarding your choices what you do with your career in life; it’s called the
Helsinki bus station. The theory of the Helsinki bus station is that when you come into this world
and learn how to speak and to do things, and specifically, or in this case, if you go to a college,
or a high school, that puts you in the bus station. What you find is that all the buses hit all the
stops leaving the city, and only after a couple stops have passed and you’re out of the city do you
start to get differentiation, where you’re ending up at stops that all the other buses weren’t
ending up at. That divergence, just like a tree, a tree has a trunk and then it has a crap load of
branches. Those branches quite literally sprout out into space, three dimensionally. Why do they
do that? The only reason that branches on a tree behave like this is because that’s where the light
is. The light isn’t where you started, because there’s something else already there, absorbing the
light, there’s a leaf in the way. Thus, you don’t get any light if you stay there.
The education system is the same way. Perhaps this tree idea is better; Scivive just invented it,
right before your eyes.

The Tree Idea: Be a Leaf Seeking Light
The tree idea of valuing and staying on the bus long enough to get the hell out of the city so
you can start to get variation and find your unique way to benefit this world. Maybe your way
isn’t unique, but you punch so much harder that you do the same tasks way better than the other
bus riders. Maybe you got off at one of those earlier stops, but you’re doing it better. If you want
to actually have a wide and varied background, and a wide and varied understanding and ability
to do things, the most poisonous thing you could do is go to the same restricted place, learn the
same restricted things from the same restricted people, for the same restricted goals. How do you
think that will work out? You’re maximizing your similarity to all those that came before you.
How are you supposed to make an impact and a difference if you started the same place, and
then made the same decisions? It’s a terrible way to start.
If you’re going to go that route, maybe you stay doing it long enough that you ride the same
idea deep enough that you can actually start to make breakthroughs at the very end. Some things
work like that, some things don’t. Some things, no one’s working on them. You could be that
guy. Maybe synthetic biology’s your thing. Maybe you think bio hacking is your thing. When
they were building Apple in a garage, they weren’t in college learning about how to build Apple.
The coolest, most profitable things that have affected our lives, a lot of them were not designed
at the end of a long bus ride. They were a short bus ride on a path that most people just didn’t
take.

Action Tips for Learning
Knowledge is knowing what to do, a skill you don’t have to win arguments or teach people. If
people aren’t going to act on the information anyway, who cares if they’re right or not? Right
and wrong are only as useful as action.
GREAT ACTIONABLE TIPS FOR LEARNING

Acquire chunks of knowledge and apply them in different settings.
Take breaks to improve your memory and your ability to solve problems.
Structure your learning. Map out prerequisites, and start with concepts that you need 80%
of the time. Prioritize knowledge that adds genuine, direct value.
Learn in differing environments, work with knowledge in differing ways and use multiple
senses.
Read other’s learning journeys, have mentors, and gain feedback. Work on your ability to
be vulnerable in order to do all of this effectively.
Leverage your emotions by making information and problems more engaging.

Learn when you’re young! It multiplies over time
Learning is the most affordable when you are young, and has the most value to multiply over
time. It affects your trajectory the most, and your acceleration, and thus your end point is
maximally influenced. What good would be learning your times tables on your last day alive?

Improve your learning by deleting non-useful stuff
Delete non-useful (history, astronomy). Insert useful (logic, ethics, mnemonics (not great but
better than history)). If the world has changed over 100 years, but the learning about it hasn’t,
you’re doing it wrong.

Re-viewing content so you don’t miss the benefit
If you’re not rewinding the video, or rereading parts of a book, it’s very likely you’re letting
the data and ideas pass right by you, and you’re going to not only miss out on it, but not even
know where to find it again when you discover you missed it. Good luck figuring out the spots
you zoned out on during an hour long video.

Past Patterns Can Point the Way to the Future
Learning about the real world, how the real world works and what is likely to happen in the
real world by having a good ability to recognize patterns and extend them into the future. This is
quite similar to knowing the past and learning from it, and thus being more accurate in your
predictions. Even more advanced, understanding statistics and being able to come up with an
estimate of how likely to be right your prediction is, and what your prediction really means (false

positive paradox, Monty Hall problem, prosecutor’s fallacy, etc.). It lets you discover and use a
way of thinking that is quite hard to arrive at by other teachings.
What some Scivivors have learned as a matter of discovery and usefulness is that you
make much better decisions and are much more aware of what is actually likely to happen in the
future when you just make a grid, and fill it on the top and side with all the possible things that
could happen. It seems like great discoveries can be made when you skip your brains natural and
useful estimations of what is probably going to happen in a situation, and actually manually chart
out all the possible outcomes you can think of.
You could consider this the brute forcing of a solution to a problem. It’s funny, sometimes
you’ll be tested on your ability to do some fancy math, and you can look at the problem
intellectually, guess a number that might be close to a solution for it. Just try sticking in a few
answers in that range and discover the solution faster by just trying some different answers that
you think might work, than it is to try to purely mathematically systematically use the real
algebra that would solve the problem.
This is similar to the statistics learnings in that, if you test positive for a thing, you don’t
have any idea how much that means you actually have the thing unless you know two things.
First, how good the test is, and here’s the magic. Second, how common is anyone to have what
you’re testing for? Then you multiply them. Better test, more likely, more people have it, also
more likely. Conversely the less common it is for people to actually have what you are testing
for, and the less accurate your test, then the less and less likely you are to actually have what
you’ve tested positive for. You must know both things, or you literally can’t know how confident
you should be in your test result.

The Time Value of Knowledge
The time value of knowledge can be easy established by trailing indicators. If you know what
the future is going to look like a minute before it happens, you can trade it and become nearly
infinitely wealthy. If, however, your indication as to the state of world is delayed by a minute,
then you’ll constantly lose every trade you make.
A trailing indicator is when you find correlation but you can’t make any money on it. Let’s
say you got Google Search Volume, Bitcoin price and you’re using Google Search Volume for

the term Bitcoin and tying it to the chart of Bitcoin’s price. You’ll find that when the searches for
Bitcoin price go up, the Bitcoin price goes up and vice versa.
Here’s the problem, which one of them comes first? A trailing indicator is something that
cannot predict the future, it’s just something that says, hey, the future already happened and
therefore you don’t get to make any money on it. Looking at a chart of the taxonomy of ideas is a
trailing indicator. It goes, I’m glad that we’ve got these new ideas that you’ve taught, put into
and order and made excellent, and now we’re going to analyze those ideas using this framework
that can just analyze what already exists between and cannot whatsoever be used to generate
anything new.
Sometimes the organization of ideas into a chart will allow you to understand what already
exists better, but will confuse you and make impossible the generation of any new thing.

Time value of knowledge and optional knowledge
There is a time value of knowledge and knowing when to learn a thing is critical. Some
knowledge is optional in the current moment, not just because you don’t need to know it now,
but because like options in the real world, you pay for them. If you buy an option and learn
something you don’t need to know, you will have paid for that option. If you use the data, the
option paid off. If you don’t use the data, you lost the time and effort of learning the depreciating
in value knowledge, at the expense of other knowledge you might have been able to act on.

Depreciating technical knowledge / false intelligence
The fallacy that being good at chess makes you good at anything else
https://medium.com/message/why-chess-will-destroy-your-mind-78ad1034521f

Educate yourself just before the task at hand
Learn what you need to know right before you’re going to do it. If you learn something long
before you’re going to act on it, the landscape may have changed and you might have to relearn
it all again, wasting your time. This is especially true for technical issues, for they are improved
so rapidly.
Consensus on who the experts are, by other experts, especially across disciplines

Expert by consensus of winners
If Tony Robbins and Tim Ferris, along with some other pretty respectable dudes both take
time out of their well curated books to speak well of the same other expert, then it’s likely that
expert is worth looking into.

Amazingly useful and dense sources of knowledge
The stickied threads in forums and discussion forums in general
The stickied posts in subreddits on right bar
Infographics
Wikis (can be dangerous if you browse too wide or deep, must maintain focus control and
choose not to learn lots.)
FAQ’s (some are too bloated.)
RTFM (Read The Fucking Manual)

Hacker News
This is last, because the reason it’s the last bastion of intelligent discussion out there.
Decay of communities over time
Puns, quips, jokes, off-topic posts, trolling, all these things amplify when there’s an audience
that rewards them. It’s self-referential, as you get the first troll, he will interact with new trolls,
thus trolls beget trolls, and jokes beget jokes.
The places with the densest, most useful information mineable places available
Summaries of the classics, some of this stuff is good.
Summaries of good modern books, a couple good ideas per book at least
Memes: All successful memes have a reason they became successful, like the /pol one
regarding “You’re much more likely to die of Y than X, so why are you upset I want you to
increase your chances of dying from x?”

Quotes and parables

Curiosity Pays Great Dividends
Curious people get really smart. By definition, we must learn about the topic in question, and
we care about it, so we’ll watch a 2-hour video about the boring topic to everyone else, because
to use, we must to fulfill our curiosity. The upside is that you can go deeper than most people,
and find happiness easier with this giant world of cool new things. The downside is you can get
locked down random paths of depreciating knowledge, or trivia, at the cost of your productivity.
There’s an art to knowing when to learn, what to learn, and when to attack.
People love to think that there’s value in things that they don’t understand, which is a
useful disbelief, because it amplifies the desire to understand that which you don’t. Curiosity
pays great dividends. When you see something, and you don’t understand it, you usually develop
a desire to understand it. Not necessarily because you think that there’s great value in
understanding it, it may be something stupid and trivial, but because you take pride in
understanding things for the sake of understanding them, despite being a waste of time.
Being curious and learning about cool shit, recognizing new patterns and ways things are
done, things that can exist and how they can exist in their forms amplifies the speed and quality
in which you can generate new forms, styles, beliefs and strategies and recognize or create
patterns that other people couldn’t, even if those actual individual things lacked quality.
Curiosity is a much better way to waste time, and experimenting and tinkering is a much better
way to waste time than say, mindless trance inducing techniques, which destroy consciousness.
Or, you know, drugging yourself into a coma.
People sometimes fall afoul over over-assigning important things that they do not
understand into pseudo-science, and into pseudo discovery. Just because you don’t understand it,
or it seems complicated, doesn’t mean that it is good or right. Just because you read a religious
text that is complicated and doesn’t make any sense, because it is poorly written, has no
frequently asked questions and has no table of contents, nor was it written in a language that you
speak or hasn’t been updated in thousands of years, and has conflicting translations, it may seem
important to you precisely because you do not truly understand it, and because it’s become
obsolete. Similar to other things that you don’t understand that do actually have value, you are
blindly assigning importance to a complicated thing where truthfully, the stuff is not accurate
and it will do more harm than good. If you accidentally assign factual truth to fiction, then you
will build your world view and your ability to make better, faster, smarter decisions in the future

on inaccurate realities that never actually existed. Therefore, you have optimized your world that
doesn’t, hasn’t and will never exist.

Best knowledge usually found with unquenchable thirst
The best knowledge can’t be read. You must beat it out of the world with your unquenchable
thirst. Science and research teaches you things that no one has ever known before in the history
in the world. Playing catch up isn’t going to make you rich.

Discover and learn by doing what works
Many great discoveries are made by accident. Many great inventors come out of liberal non-
technical arts educations. Lots of people find money lying in the street. Who cares? You can
either do what you know leads to an outcome, or mess around and try everything but that, and
see what gets you there faster. Try walking home by going every direction but home, and I think
you’ll quickly figure out which one works better.
If you can’t find the knowledge you seek, you may need to create and discover it yourself.
General ideas you can try new places

Pushing-Pulling Effect
There’s an efficiency of stairs over ramps. You’ll notice that stairs also take more material
to construct, and I think that an analogy can be made between how most multicellular living
organisms appear to operate with a structure of hard surfaces and polling services, so basically
tension.
You have hard things, which basically take no effort at all to resist compression; it’s just
their natural form. Then you have tendons and muscles that do the soft pulling stuff. It’s just an
interesting concept that in effect, like when you stand up, you’re not really using that much
energy, because you’ve got things balanced just right. You’re taking advantage of non-
compressing properties of bone. That makes you wonder where else in the world we should see a
similar pushing-pulling opposite effect. This could be similarly illustrated by constructing with
concrete and rebar, because rebar resists the pulling and concrete resist the pushing.

Cross Pollination-al Discovery
The use of the word accident to describe scientific breakthroughs and discoveries that
happened in a lab while you were looking for a different thing is kind of a waste of the term
accident. The term accident that people are used to is an accidental thing that occurred that you
weren’t expecting. However, if you’re in a material science lab and you find a new material that
does some weird shit, you were in the lab. You put in a couple $100K of equipment, $100K into
personnel, $100K of education, you got a half a million dollars sitting there trying to make
discoveries, and you just happened to discover something different.
That’s not an accident. If you’re flipping burgers at Burger King, you’re not discovering shit.
I think a new word should be invented for the cross pollination, cross-jurisdictional, sideways
discovery of something in a discovery palace called a lab.

Know the difference between a test and an experiment
It’s important to understand the difference between experiments and testers. If you test
something, you have a very reasonable expectation of what passing and failing looks like. As a
person grading the test you learn very little. If someone gives you a multiple choice test and you
do well, the tester learns basically nothing other than how well you did on the test. If you are
given a slightly different test, which is much more subjective in its grading, if you are told to
write a ten page essay on the most important problem in the world, now the tester is not only
going to learn what you have decided to choose as the most important problem in the world, but
also might learn something about that which you have written about.
Knowing the difference between a test and an experiment is that it’s a lot easier to learn from
experiments, because you aren’t sure of what the range of possible solutions is, and you’re trying
to perform learning as your goal. “I’m doing this experiment; I want to see what happens. That’s
why it’s an experiment; it’s an attempt to see what happens.” A useful definition of the
difference between a test and an experiment is your intention as to whether you’re trying to learn
something, or whether you’re just trying to give someone else a great thing that makes a big
difference and is separate from your tension. How wide is the possible solution set? When you
do an experiment, the range of solutions that you would accept as proper outputs is all of them,

assuming you performed a good experiment and didn’t screw it up. When you give a test, the
range of solutions that you would be comfortable with receiving are very specific.
The most important thing you can learn from knowing the difference between a test and an
experiment is that you’re going to learn a lot more from being open-minded, experimenting and
looking for learning and building on discoveries that were unexpected. You’re going to get more
out of experiments than you would out of tests. There’s probably little else that you could do to
learn less from another party than give them a multiple choice test. How are you going to learn
from that? What are you going to learn? Not much.

Learn and Use Google-fu
We have the most powerful knowledge finding tool the world has ever seen instantly and
freely available to us. What a great time to be alive! If all the knowledge of the world is nearly
free, then how can you secure advantage for yourself over your competitors in this world of
limited resources? The answer lies in being able to find better knowledge than they can, faster
than they can. Enter Google-fu, defined as “skill in using search engines (especially Google) to
quickly find useful information on the Internet.”
Why wouldn’t the most powerful search tool on the planet have some bad ass rarely known
functionality?

Side channel search collision attack:................................................................................

Search Operators
Search operators are words that can be added to searches to help narrow down the results.
Don’t worry about memorizing every operator, because you can also use the Advanced Search
page to create these searches.

Operator How to use it
site: Get results from certain sites or
domains.
Examples: olympics site:nbc.com and
olympics site:.gov
link: Find pages that link to a certain page.
Example: link:YouTube.com
related: Find sites that are similar to a web
address you already know.
Example: related:time.com
OR Find pages that might use one of
several words.
Example: marathon OR race
info: Get information about a web address,
including the cached version of the
page, similar pages, and pages that link
to the site.
Example: info:google.com
cache: See what a page looks like the last
time Google visited the site.
Example: cache:washington.edu
Note: When you search using operators or punctuation marks, don’t add any spaces between
the operator and your search terms. A search for site:nytimes.com will work, but site:
nytimes.com won’t.

Memory and Education
Importance
Check out how large the memory section is on this Wikipedia page:
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy
If you want retain more memory of what you were reading, or doing, you must retrace your
steps, and reopen your tabs, go back through the same steps the best you can remember them.
Take a picture of your parking spot, so you can’t forget where you left your car. Put your keys

Learning

Teach the Amplifiers First
If math doesn’t help language and language doesn’t help math, why don’t we teach first
things that amplify everything else? If someone is learning harder than another person, and you
asked why, one could say “because I want to be the best.” Or, “I want to be better than that other
the competition” or, “I want to feel proud of myself”. Teaching pride, excellence and
competition, those things affect everything, you should teach them first. If you don’t get those, if
you don’t make people care, well then really, how hard do you think they’re going to work
anywhere else? Discipline and motivation are the tides that raise all educational subjects’ ships.
Amplifiers
Amplifiers and chemical stimulants such Caffeine, amphetamines, and the chemicals your
own brain can make after meditating or firing an empowering pattern off can amplify your brain
abilities.
Habit

Mindset
Internal language
The tricks you use to keep exercising are the same tricks you can use to keep thinking about
hard things. “If I can’t, I must” See the structure. Abstract, categorize, chunk, and then act well.
There is nothing but the work. Your mind will hit you every few seconds to do the old bad things
you used to do, and as you tell your mind otherwise, after a while, it just stops trying to get you
to do stupid things. As you starve out the old habit, eventually it just dies.
You only need to master a couple of things here to become great, meaning you surely don’t
need to master half of all the possible things to learn. As a matter of fact, you’d probably be
much better off only learning a few of these things and excel greatly at them, rather than being
relatively bad at all of them. The reason for this is that many of the things here help you
personally much more than they help the rest of the world, that you are much better off focusing
on the things that benefit the rest of the world much more than they benefit you.
This works because the world can do more than you can. 1000 men can build something
amazing, something that try as you might, you could never build alone in your lifetime, or even a
thousand lifetimes. The chance that you can greatly influence this world in conjunction with
many of your fellow man is at least 100 times greater than the chance that you can achieve the
same thing alone. Why? Take a look around you, how many of the things you use, enjoy, see,
were made by a single man or woman? Almost nothing was made without the help of others.

Be a Discoverer of Truth
How does this relate to the rest of reality that is vastly less tested nor testable? I believe the
learning is that you must look for that other magic part that is so hard to miss, you must look for
the not thing, you must look for the thing that isn’t there, or is the opposite of the obvious thing.
Ask yourself, “What’s the missing part? What should be here that isn’t here?” It’s like a great
investigator you might see in a popular television show, movie or book, you could say Sherlock
Holmes, Colombo, or Dr. House. They account for the following things lesser detectives never
think of: Is my test wrong? Could it be wrong in this case for special reason? Did something
intermittent happen here, is the current state of the scene not representative of when the crime
occurred, rain, weather, people, full moon, Lighting?

Minimum Viable Education
What is the minimum effective dose of teachable knowledge/skill? Input, process, output, ala
grammar, logic, rhetoric, trivial fame.
Success leaves clues. The most effective students (and teachers) often have little mental tricks
they apply when thinking, some are mnemonic, some are turning ideas into locations, some are
pretending new ideas are just like old ideas, and applying the old learnings, etc. Find those
powerful commonalities that work best for you.
Stop turning kids into bad versions of Google. We don’t need more bad data storage in
human minds; we need more of what the machines can’t do yet, creativity, emotional decision,
morality, and love.
If you must make kids bad versions of Google and shove facts into them for lousy storage,
then at least teach them mnemonic technique and logic first, Google-fu, so as to amplify all their
future efforts. Do not teach the amplifiers last, let those amplifiers pay dividends over time while
learning the other stuff. Some are lucky enough to have logic taught to them first before any
other math at grade 6, because of an experimental advanced education system. After logic they
learn scheme programming. Those frameworks greatly help some individuals, as nesting of ideas
and good data processing is super powerful in all the other areas of life.
Better and worse exist, find better, and choose better. Do not be a coward and pretend that
worse doesn’t exist.
Summary: teach amplifiers first. Then teach minimum effective commonly useful data
processing, then specialize, focus, and become great. Specialization is why we have genders.
Dimorphism lets us not over-allocate excellence in a single place at the cost of another place.
Great things come from specialists. If the value of skill is in opposite proportion to supply of that
skill, then everyone learning the same things by definition means no one will pay for that skill or
knowledge. There’s some exclusions to that idea, such as language itself, however the theme of
slapping knowledge/skill on a supply/demand curve is a good one. Much of this idea is hammer
in

Xx check Peter Thiel’s 0-1. Less 1 to 1 horizontal iteration and more 0 to 1, no one else is
working on this thing kind greatness.

What is minimum effective curriculum before specializing?
What is the minimum viable education?
What is the correct execution order of those skills?
For instance, how important is it to teach kids to write essays, when they actually don’t have
much useful to say? Maybe you should work much harder on having useful things to say before
you learn how to beautifully say them. Imagine that you did the opposite, imagine that you
taught effective rhetoric before logic, and now you’ve got better salesmen of bad ideas. That’s
worse for the world and the individual, not better. Think of the places in the world where women
aren’t allowed to drive cars. How did that terrible situation arise? The answer is great marketing
and the spread of terrible ideas..

STEAL IDEAS FROM OTHER LIFEFORMS BEFORE THEY DIE OFF
Steal Ideas from Other Organisms
Which organisms are we most likely to benefit from stealing ideas from? Can we prevent
them from going extinct before we get to learn those ideas? Is there a way to capture their ideas,
pre-extinction? Even the tools that we now have to change the blueprints of life, we stole from
life. For example, bacteria and viruses are currently the source of our most powerful DNA
editing tools. We are meat, and animals are meat. The animals of Earth benefit from all kinds of
amazing tricks and tools their meat has developed. We could use some of their tools, but if they
become extinct, we can’t learn as well from them any longer. Think of how much more we could
learn about (and from) dinosaurs, if they weren’t currently extinct.
If you want to take advantage of the millions of years of building with the best tools we’re
aware of, real evolution over long time periods, without having to wait for millions of years for
the next go round of that thing maybe mutating and evolving again, then you should try to
prevent the extinction of the organisms most useful to learn from for our own benefit. The same
could be said for studying an organism’s specific feature before it changes and evolves further.
(Again, think viruses and bacteria and immunotherapy tactics)

Real World Testing By Doing..............................................................................................
Why test kids when you can put them in the real world via the Internet, and have those kids
solve real, currently relatable problems? In this way, you can achieve real world testing by doing,
by action. There are all kinds of people out there that have problems that they’d like to have
solved, and these useless kids could be the ones to do it. However, if you can’t find a thing in the
real world for these kids to use to practice on, then stop teaching it, it’s obvious no one needs it,
or you don’t know anyone in the real world, one of the two.

Teaching Through Stories Instead of Fact Bashing
Teaching through story sacrifices bitrate for emotional attachment and depth for stickiness
and virility. This might be why viruses have a quite limited payload.
For a religion to succeed, it must actually have a church, a belief structure that tends the heart
and the songs and ritual stuff that goes around it, and often sadly the “us vs them” mentality.
Common parts of good stories: Arc, relation, father/son, dark/light, mirror, order, reversal,
betrayal, greed, lust, conflict, struggle, what are these common powerful tropes? Which do you
like the most? Using us vs them language.
Easy way to learn
If you ever want an easy way to teach kids the importance of geometry, one 18-inch pizza is
more pizza than two 12-inch pizzas. Do the math.
Don’t let school interfere with your education
“I never let school interfere with my education” - Mark Twain
Wasting too much time in college
How could any learned man be satisfied to waste away in a college or university building
ideas that are going on quite literally in the real world?

The Cinderella Effect
Separating kids from parents and giving to state for education e.g. the republic (Plato’s) is at
least bad because of this:
“In evolutionary psychology, the Cinderella effect is the alleged higher incidence of different
forms of child-abuse and mistreatment by stepparents than by biological parents. It takes its
name from the fairy tale character Cinderella. Evolutionary psychologists describe the effect as a
remnant of an adaptive reproductive strategy among primates in which males frequently kill the
offspring of other males in order to bring their mothers into estrus, and give the male a chance to
fertilize her himself. There is both supporting evidence for this theory and criticisms against it.”

Failure of Education system
Essays-section of the book store hides great ideas
It’s rather stupid that much of what you need to be a great person, and to develop correct
beliefs and actions in this world, is hidden away in the essays section of the library and the book
store. What a stupid way to name an important category of the most in depth thinking. Why are
Hitchens and Nietzsche and Ralph Waldo Emerson, Machiavelli, Henry David Thoreau, Will
Durant, etc. hidden in this stupid category? This category is literally called something we’re
taught to hate as kids.
The failure of the education system (Xx There’s more content like this in the World section)

Kids Know Their Time Is Being Wasted with Useless Knowledge
Kids know their time is being wasted with useless knowledge. Kids know you’re wasting their
time; they know they’re never going to use this shit. If you’re too stupid to come up with an
example that’s compelling to them when they would use it, then you’re dumber than they are,
because you don’t realize that you’re wasting their time. Stop wasting everyone’s time. There’s
enough to learn in this world that’s actually useful to learn, teach them that. If you have an hour
of math, an hour of history, an hour of home-ed, where’s your hour of motivation? Where’s your
hour of visualizing the future? Where’s your hour of finding something to care about? Where’s
your hour of planning and dreaming something that spices you up? Where’s your hour of the

amplifier and multiplier? Find the only weak link in the chain that will make any of those other
six or seven hours of school worthwhile. Teaching people things they will never use or teaching
people things that they could use if they cared, is only as useful as the caring. No caring, no
using. You need to be amplifying the strong part of the chain, not the weak part. A chain is only
as strong as its weakest link..
We have a motivation problem and they don’t teach that in schools
We do not have a knowledge problem. We do not have an education problem. We have a
desire, and will, and motivation, and discipline problem. These ideas needs to become a class of
their own, they need to have a curriculum and they need to be taught, people need to get degrees
in these areas instead of Liberal Arts. You should be able to meet someone not having to go
through some esoteric business training class, and not having to go through some religious
experience.

Liberal Arts Degrees and the Education System..................................................................
Everyone gets these liberal arts degrees and goes to a liberal arts college, and no one knows
what liberal arts means. Some claim to know, because they went to college for a while, and they
were surrounded by other people that went to colleges. Yet some may end up determining that it
was like applying butter to a piece of bread; you liberally apply butter to bread because it tastes
good.
It turns out that in reality, in the liberal arts, the word liberal means “free.” They made it a
long time ago, say 2,300 to 2,400 years ago, around 300-400 BC. People decided that the trades,
such as building and farming and commerce, such as shop keeping and things like that, were for
idiots. Those skillsets were the lowest things you could learn. It was also decided that a person
with freedom should learn seven awesome things. Then they categorized those seven awesome
things into a set of three and a set of four.
The set of three, the trivium (from the Latin for “where three roads meet”) which is also the
root of the word “trivialis,” which means “that which is in, or belongs to, the crossroads or public
streets; hence, that may be found everywhere, common,” from which comes the recent word
“trivia.”

they didn’t even like these three things. You might understand it as reading, writing, and
arithmetic. They understood it as grammar (which is getting data in), logic (manipulating the
data), and rhetoric (speaking the data and getting the data back out). They didn’t even look up to
that, that badass idea of input-processing-output system. They didn’t even like that. That was
where you started, and where you were to end up was the four things that they actually liked.
In the medieval European university, the seven liberal arts were grammar, rhetoric, and logic
(the trivium) and geometry, arithmetic, music, and astronomy (the quadrivium). These next four,
once learned, you’ll have a complete understanding of what the liberal arts are. Notice that
they’re not building, they’re not engineering, they’re not business, they’re not medicine, they’re
not the things that are the most useful things in the whole world even though some think that
they’re the most important.

Multiple choice tests should be destroyed - no more accidental success.
Our education system was designed a thousand years ago
The entire education system was designed around a system that was beneficial a thousand
years ago. The world that we live in today is not very like the world that we lived in then.
Business, medicine, and the things that people look down upon now, those are the important
things. The things that they thought were important, like philosophy - eh, we’ve kind of got most
of that stuff figured out. We don’t need more people in that area. If you don’t think that we’ve
made diminishing returns in the philosophy area, there’s 200,000 people a day dying right now.
What percentage of those people are dying from lack of philosophy? They’re dying because their
bodies are falling apart. That’s 200,000 people a day, and one day soon, you will be one of those
people. If you don’t want to be a rotting piece of meat, a walking corpse with a short lifespan,
less than a blink of an eye geologically, then you should be focused on shit that gets you to stick
around a little bit longer. If you find yourself following the suggestions of thousands of years
old, dead people, who optimized for a world that they lived in, that is not very like the world that
you live in, you are wasting your time.
If you’re taking liberal arts and you don’t understand that the choices, the false choices, the
artificially restricted choices that you get to choose from in regards to your curriculum exist
because some wrong person has decided that music and philosophy are anywhere near as
important as engineering and medicine, then you’re making the wrong choice.

Here are the points to summarize. We understand what the liberal arts are. It’s a judgment
call. It’s an artificial restriction of your choices where you think you’re getting a wide, balanced,
well-rounded education, when in reality you’re being crippled. You are being taught the least
valuable information that you can learn. You are learning things that are the very opposite of
useful when it comes to matters of most importance.

The Education Bubble
We’ve had all types of bubbles in this world. We’ve had bubbles in housing, we’ve had
bubbles in stock markets, and now there’s a bubble in the education system. And bubbles -
unfortunately, human beings psychologically don’t react well to them. We’re okay with increases
in pay, we’re okay with increases in quality of life, but we’re dissatisfied with decreases in pay
and decreases in quality of life. It’s called the Keynesian ratcheting effect in economics. Just like
a ratchet, turns easily one way, doesn’t turn so easily the other way. When you have a bubble in
education because people have forgotten why education exists, education is not supposed to be
babysitting at the collegiate level. Education is not supposed to be learning for learning’s sake,
and if it ever was, never mind those people. That was a bad decision, a bad design. There’s a
better way to live, more important shit to learn. You should believe in utility. You should believe
in Scivival.
This is what liberal arts and much of what the education that exists in this world is. It’s
learning the names of things and learning that they exist, and never deriving useful value, or
getting any type of actual benefit. Learning to learn, for learning’s sake, so that you can say you
did, and take a regurgitated test where you vomit facts back on the paper the same way that you
learned them in the first place. Then you rapidly forget those facts because you never use it again
in the real world. Nothing could be worse. What could be worse than convincing someone that to
be a good person in a society, and to be useful in a society, they need to learn things that don’t
matter and understand them in a way that’s not useful, only to forget them again shortly
thereafter? What could be worse when their life and their consciousness and the supporting of
their family and the obtainment of their goals revolve around all of the things that you excluded
from their education?

Personal finance, and personal presentation can improve based on the questions you ask of
yourself. How to be a good friend? How to be fair to yourself? What does being fair to yourself
look like? What does being fair to your friends look like? What does being too easy on others
look like? What does losing friends because you didn’t get things signed in writing and then now
their own subconscious works against them and they misremember the past? Sometimes it’s
financially profitable for them to misremember the past. Our minds are structured in a way that
makes it very easy to misremember the past, especially if we gain from such.

Liberal Arts Degrees
If you still think the liberal arts are there to teach you how to learn, you misunderstand why
they are there. There is a study of how people learn, there is the ability to major in education,
there is the study of where knowledge comes from, there’s a fancy word for it. If you want to
learn what is knowable and how we know what is knowable, and perhaps the best ways to learn
things, if you think learning things is memorizing things, well then you should study memory,
and that should be a course. People who compete in memory competitions could teach such a
course. It wouldn’t be surprising if the liberal arts removed that from the ability of the course
selection guide, because it’s too damn useful. We need things that are less useful, so that we turn
people into losers. They don’t understand they’re losers, because we use proof by complexity.

Better Education Results With Scivive
If Scivive can get you better results for yourself in a shorter time frame than college does, is
not the education you get with Scivival worth more money, especially since it is saving you more
of your finite time?

Be Sure You Know What You’re Learning
If you didn’t take ethics and learn how to be a good friend, how to manage your personal
finances, and how to stick up for yourself and how to be fair to yourself, you spent your time the
wrong way. Everyone in the entire world knows that those things are vitally important. If you
learned the order of the planets from the sun outward instead of those better things, you spent
your time the wrong way. You are less effective and less of a good person and a less powerful

being now because you deprived yourself. Maybe by accident, maybe through ignorance, you
didn’t know you could learn those better things. If you think liberal arts teach you how to learn,
that’s called epistemology, and you can go into that and education and the study of learning as a
thing. When they’re teaching you music, they’re not teaching you how to learn. When they’re
teaching you writing, they’re not teaching you how to use your memory - they’re different
things. Don’t fall for the hype, don’t fall for the bullshit. If you want to create super learners, you
had best believe that the topics you study won’t look anything like the curriculums that are out
there now.

Seek a Wide-Ranging Education
We’ve gone far and wide. In summary, if you think the liberal arts are giving you a clear,
unbiased option of learning from all the things that are learnable, you are widely far from the
mark. In colleges, you get to choose from a course list. That course list is taught by humans.
Those humans teach what they feel they’re capable of teaching and often times with a hell of a
lot of guidelines. You could not find a more restrictive, less choice-based, less varied, less
structured way to learn a thing on the whole planet. It’s the most organized, the least
adventurous, and the least varied. There’s the least number of options available to you.
That’s the opposite of a wide-ranging education.
A wide-ranging education would be you opening an encyclopedia or an atlas and you pointing
to a page, and that’s what you’re learning. There you go. You have all the things available to
you. Having available to you to learn all the things, that’s actually a wide-ranging education.
That’s actually how you might find a passion that other people haven’t that you can profit from.
That’s how you can find an excellence; by diving deeper into an area than other people have.

Chronological education: first one fact, then the next
The education system revolves around you not getting to learn a new thing until you learn the
last thing. In which case, if you didn’t completely grasp the last thing, you don’t get to learn the
next thing. They keep you in that class again and again and again and then and only then when
they think you’ll benefit from a harder class that builds upon the lessons learned do you earn the
opportunity to learn that new thing.

If all the knowledge is free, then why would you pay for an education? If the knowledge is
free, what are you paying for? To waste your time and your money listening to regurgitated facts
and methods that you could discover on your own had you found the motivation to do so?
How do you tell who is smart

Teaching People Knowledge They Can Use
If you want people to actually learn, know that there are things that the student never uses,
and avoid those things while conducting the lesson. Instead, you can make a simple study guide
that you expect them to finish, which you can charge for, that they can actually use. So if you are
taught to go on Alibaba, buy something you like, stock it at home, sell it, you’ll get rich. That’s
one thing. You’ll learn that setting up an account at Alibaba is the first step. Then you need to
understand how to log in, find the bestsellers. Next, you’re going and looking in the retail
market, you’re seeing what price they sell for, discovering that there’s enough profit. Next,
you’re going to place an order and you need to have it shipped the most effective way to your
house. Then you’re going to put an ad out. It’s going to have your phone number and you’re
actually going to answer it.
Walking you through the steps and actually getting you to do them and holding you to a
higher standard is more valuable to you then just knowing a thing exists. Knowing that sales
exist is nothing compared to being able to sell. Knowing that dancing exists is nothing compared
to being able to dance.
Posting premium content on the web about a thing that can be done well, and displaying some
ways to do it may or not may be enough. Getting students into your paid program where, because
they’ve paid, they’ll actually follow through the steps with more intent. It wouldn’t take long to
discover that if people don’t pay, they don’t follow through, because they’re less invested in the
idea from the start. Look at the completion rate for massive online courses versus normal
courses. It’s like four times higher for a normal course. Why? Because people paid for it, they
see loss, they feel sense of loss and so if you’re in the education business, you should have paid
content. You should have free content. You probably should even consider changing the price of
your content occasionally, like drug companies do based on who’s buying it.
They charge you money to do it, they take all of your time to do it, and it was all based on
a judgment call made up many thousands of years ago as to why these ephemeral, hard to iterate

on, hard to get feedback on, way of learning and teaching lessons. When this dynamic was
created long ago, individuals and groups found it hard to even choose one way of living over
another way of living, let alone teaching how to do so. We know one way of building beats the
shit out of another one, because we can measure it.

Failure of the education system........................................................................................
Isn’t it a little odd that business professionals pay thousands of dollars to go to boot camps to
learn could be easily taught in school? (or a webinar) Things like scheduling, goal setting,
positive feedback and loops?
Imagine someone with a flabby arm, and they’re having a conversation with it, looking at it
and saying to it, “I don’t understand this flabby arm. I want it to be stronger.” Then, you tell it
about all the different ways that it can get stronger; about eating protein, about doing curls and
chin-ups, and doing pull-ups, and all the things that would help it grow. However, it just sits
there and it just doesn’t do anything. No matter how many different things you tell it, it never
gets stronger. And that you see, is the reason that education doesn’t work properly. We don’t
need more people to be told things. We need the people to do things.

Value the Meaning of Words
Stop diminishing the meaning of the word “survivor.” It’s not particularly accurate when they
call everyone a survivor, such as a divorce survivor - is divorce usually fatal? What’s the point of
the word survivor, if you didn’t avoid being killed? Using the word survivor here is over
sensationalizing the point. Should there perhaps, exist a new word for a person who has avoided
being divorced, as survivors have avoided being killed? Stop breaking the language; because you
endure something negative, horrible and terrible, doesn’t make you a survivor, surviving an
encounter makes you a survivor, and surviving means avoiding death when the threat of death
was imminent. If you got into a fight with a bear, got all your arms and legs ripped off, and still
survived, then you’re a survivor. Notice, you still lose the fight pretty bad, however, even in
losing, you are a survivor, because you didn’t die, despite the bear’s ability to easily kill you.
If there was no threat of death, it’s the wrong word. Go make a new word for enduring and
living with events that are unfortunate. Don’t steal the word survivor from the countless people
that actually avoided potentially life ending circumstances. It’s supposed to be a badge of honor,

not a badge of sadness. Cancer survivor is a term that’s accurate. “Survivor of the stock market
crash,” is the wrong use of the word.

Process
Creativity
Stop listening so that you may speak.
If you spend all your time absorbing music which other people created;
reading books which other people created; watching movies which other people
created; watching other people have fun; listening to other people’s jokes - it is
very hard to be producing, when you’re absorbing. Humans are not full duplex,
(simultaneous send/receive) you can’t really listen when you’re talking, you
can’t really talk when you’re listening, you can’t really create or be an
individual or do that thing that only you can do, if you’re busy absorbing
everyone else’s consciousness and not formulating your own consciousness.
Now, do you need to start your life absorbing other people’s
consciousness? Yes, you do. You just need to learn a language, learn various
customs, learn to thrive, eat, break bread, make love, and enjoy life. You need
to do that. Once you’ve learned enough of that, got the low hanging fruit, and
once you got the Pareto principle; 80 percent of the results for 20 percent of the
input, you need to switch gears - you need to give back. You’ve been a child;
you’ve eaten from your father’s hand - time to be a father. You spoke the
language, you use the language, and you read the words – now it’s time to make
your own words. You think that there’s not a place in this world that you can
have an impact, but if you focus your mind regardless of how incapable you
might think you are, with enough focus you can make a lasting impact.
You don’t exist if your mind is only composed of other people’s thoughts.
You must give your mind the freedom and the blank canvas to paint your own
identity, to sing your song out into the world, and be heard as no one ever
before you. To be only a mirror of the random media and friends that you
interact with, is to waste the unique gifts your ancestors passed down to you. Be
yourself, be the best you can be. Choose who that is. Don’t be lazy with it. Your
standards for who you demand you will be, are the most important standards
you will ever have.
Silence is golden
In a world where being creative is so valuable, it literally pays to know
that your brain loves to fill silence with cool ideas of its own. That’s why
people come up with such interesting ideas in the shower, but much rarer
in other places, for the shower is one of the few places that people choose
silence and solitude. Rejecting the noise of the world lets your amazing
autonomous pattern finding and creative brain do what it does better than
any other machine on the planet, generate interesting and possible futures.
Sit in silence, but not as a monk trying to destroy thought. Love your
thought, play with your thought, it is the closest thing to the real you
you’re likely to find if you search. Pay attention to your own thoughts and
explore them as you would the mind of someone you’d just met for the
first time. What’s going on in this organic, bio-chemical super computer
when you rest your eyes?
Being uniquely creative
Everything is copied. You need to keep your ears and eyes open, or you’ll
converge on the same ideas others do, without realizing it. For example, a lot of
comedians try not to watch other comedy, because they think that somehow it’s
going to prevent them from accidentally plagiarizing other people’s jokes. What
they don’t understand is that they’ll just accidentally do them a different way.
They’ll accidentally do them by having a global consciousness affect them and
execute the same joke through their mind, through a third party instead of
directly from watching the comedy show, and forgetting that they remembered
it. The moral of the story there is, we have the same error in our own
experiences where we are trying to avoid polluting our brains with other
content.
Everything is copied

Harnessing your natural processing power
Why set theory works
Your brain Is great at knowing where things are in relationship to other
things, because it is really useful for getting around in the world, and because of
that, you will find that taking ideas and putting them into groups and sets in
your mind, allows you to harness your positional and navigational based
intelligence and harness it towards ideas that don’t really have real places in the
real world, or even physical forms that you can touch or interact with.
That is part of the reason that set theory and Venn diagrams allow you to
understand complex ideas so much easier, because they act as a convolution
layer that takes their nonphysical form and coverts it in your mind into a
physical representation so you can work with it. This is kind of like how when
video cards were first released, and it was discovered they could solve certain
problems faster than CPUs, and that you could take your problem and make it
look like the things that graphics cards were good at working with, and then you
could harness that power.
This is similar to how when you construct or inspect a building, you take
its measurements and turn them into numbers that calculators and equations are
good at working on. You couldn’t very well take your 2”x4” piece of lumber
and insert it directly into the calculator to perform calculations on, the calculator
would break and your teacher would get pretty angry at you. So you create an
abstraction and turn the piece of wood you want to work on into a middle layer
of numbers that you can then harness the processing power of the calculator
with. Then when you’ve got the numbers that you need, you can export that data
out of the number layer back into the wood layer of the real world again, and
perhaps build a house.
Sleep
Sleep thought might be better than awake thought
There is a chance that you learn more and think about better things when
you’re sleeping than when you’re awake. It’s basically a time when your mind
truly gets to decide what it shall focus on. If you never slept, then much more of

your focus would be controlled by the media, your habits, etc. Perhaps all the
crazy situations and scenarios you dream about are actually more important to
your survival and growth than much of what you might be normally thinking
about during the day, even though you have more control over your thoughts
while awake. Perhaps loss of that control is the key.
Focus
What not to focus on
Working on the unique versus improving/marketing the already known
Unique useful data is the most valuable to the world
Non unique data is usually more actionable to you
Ideas are only as useful as people are aware of them.
The global awareness of an idea is
Probabilistic
Marketing based
Trend based
If you find a great idea that’s under marketed, or misunderstood,
fix it. If you see an idea that needs to be created, create it. Creating
new ideas or testing and proving others is more useful globally and
throughout time than creating yet another copy of the same ideas
already out there. This assumes that the old ideas already have good
distribution networks by having allowed them to spread effectively
and have their value judged by peers. Should you build new ideas or
spread good but under-marketed ones? Build or spread, or build then
spread?
Counting from 0
Counting from zero seems stupid, until you try to figure out which is the best time
to get pregnant to have your child’s birthday match the same as your own. Let’s say
you are born on October 1st. Kids take 9 months from conception to birth. So 9
months after the years starts would be the 9th month right?
September is the right month right? So you should get pregnant January first. Oh
but wait, it takes 9 full months. Nine full months after January comes October. The

end of September begins the 9th month, which has number 10. Now you know why
programmers count from 0.
This could also be described by, (instead of counting from zero) Saying 9
complete months or the end of 9 months, (starting the 10th) also makes it intuitive.
This seems similar to the fencepost error where you need n+1 because you must end
after the end of the fence segment.
Intelligence
General Intelligence
The folly of measuring Intelligence
First, intelligence isn’t knowledge. Measuring intelligence is a
little misleading and stupid. Here is an example; most people don’t
know the difference between intelligence and knowledge, so we can
throw either word around the common misunderstanding by never
using the word intelligence as the scientists do. This is the same
problem with the language that is used oddly and specifically in the
social science in regards to humans having no instincts, whereas the
common man will tell you we definitely do, such as the fear of
heights, or the survival instinct, fight or flight response, all kinds of
stuff, however, they don’t call those things instincts the same way
that researchers don’t want knowledge to be called intelligence.
Natural IQ Selection
If you think tall parents tend to have tall kids, and short parents
short kids, then probably slate-950 parents slate-950 kids. If there’s so much
heredity going on, and we’re all pretty heavily influenced by our
ancestors, and our ancestors were individually differently stupid or
smart from each other, then why would it be so hard to believe that
the same mechanism that changed your color and your language also
changed your IQ or reaction time, or even habitual tendencies? There
is no god damn equality, please stop dreaming. The difference that
existed in those individuals then got executed and perhaps amplified

through the ages and through time, and low and behold, we now
have differences, just like they had.
Apparently no one has made the case as to why being less
intelligent could be an advantage that could be selected for. First,
just because it’s not as far as long as some other populations selected
for trait, it doesn’t mean that it is not being selected for, in terms of
evolution, it just might be taking longer as the result of chance.
Second, it takes lots of calories to maintain these brains, and one
would assume harder thinking, more thinking, would incur more
caloric cost. And third, ever seen a nerd busy thinking instead of
lifting weights?
Hard studying increases your appetite, even though studying hard
(increased brain work) only increases caloric burn very little.
If there’s a case to be made that the smarter you are the weaker
you are, generally, then why wouldn’t that be useful in an
environment where you’re always chasing your food? There are
many reasons that being too smart for a thing makes you bad at the
thing. Have you heard that you can’t get hired as a police officer if
your IQ is too high? Perhaps they’re making the right decision for
the resources they have, in that it costs too much to train cops that
quit, because they move on to better things.

Big G (General Intelligence)

If you were deprived of basically all enriching information and
born on an island, just existed and didn’t have culture or have never
heard a joke, or never heard a song, you would still have the Big G
that you were born with. Let’s see Big G for what it is: it’s a useful
metric to decide whether there are some exercises that have good
fall-over usefulness.
Qualitative value of applied knowledge
Doing the right stuff first
If you’re the smart guy that’s done all the right stuff first,
you can make gold out of other people’s mishaps, whereas if
you’re the one lacking, you can’t make shit out of other
people’s greatness.
There is an uncanny effectiveness of children brought up
with a focused goal; Tiger Woods, polar sisters Magnus

The question that you should have for yourself is what’s a word,
what’s a description that exists or should be invented that describes a
person that gets the benefits from excellence of knowledge and
action, and doesn’t live without the great benefits of excellent
knowledge and action applied in the real world? Is there a word to
describe the vast, vast number of intelligent, capable and genius
level, literally genius level, such as learn a new language in a couple
weeks if you want to read a book in that language, madness shit,
Wittgenstein level stuff? It’s funny, the number of these geniuses
that are Jewish. He was Jewish, by the way, like three-quarters
Jewish. It seems to be a lot easier to be a super-genius if you’re
Jewish in this world. What’s the word for people that know a great
thing, but don’t do it? Is it hypocrite? Perhaps it fits. A hypocrite will
say that people should do a thing, but they exclude themselves from
the set that they call people, or make up a fancy excuse for why they
don’t need to. Maybe calling those people hypocrites is the answer.
On second thought, it doesn’t seem artful enough.
There’s a difference between quality of belief and quality of
intellect, and the ability to synthesize ideas with a person. Two
people could be in the same place, or achieve the same solution but
arrive there by totally different mechanisms. One person may
stumble into a local bar, because limited motivation (or available
options) determined this was the best bar available, whereas
someone else is there because they searched TripAdvisor and read
that it was the most delicious place in the world. In this scenario, two
patrons arrive at the same place at the same time, but through
drastically different methods; one person found this place due to the
end result of a hunt for excellence, while the other patron was there
because they had no other options. A lot of ideas and behaviors in
this world are arrived at by similarly opposing methods - some
people arrive at a belief through ignorance and some through
complete knowledge. If you think that both of those people are
equally qualified to speak on issues because they chose the same
action, well, then you’re in for a rude awakening. This is because
one, through complete knowledge one has a lot of new options,
things you can learn.
As for the person that arrived there through ignorance or was
forced there, well you can’t really build anything new with that guy.
The learning of order of operations is really important for being
effective. Some math you can’t do in a randomized order. In other words,
some equations are not commutative. The same is true for martial arts. If
you learn all the fake ones before the real ones, you’re basically starting
from scratch, but if you learn the real ones and then observe the fake ones,
then you basically kind of just adopt what’s useful and ignore what’s
impractical. It’s kind of the same with critical thinking. If you take a

person that’s a great critical thinker, and you put them in an environment
of stupidity and falsehood, although there may still be a few good ideas
there, he’s more qualified to pick out the good ideas and ignore the crap.
Therefore, if you’re a smart, critical thinking guy, you could probably
derive benefit from reading lots of things that are terrible, things which
may cripple or poison a weaker mind. It’s like the ability to be an
omnivore and digest the things that are useful while remaining immune to
the things that are harmful. It’s really an order of operations issue. If you
get the wrong books first, you cripple yourself and get the worst things,
the wrong things, out of the subsequent books. If you instead read the right
books first, then it just amplifies your progress, even when reading subpar
book later on. That’s why the rich get richer, the smart get smarter, and the
divergence grows..

Mere awareness is not a skill
Mere awareness is not a skill. Similar to all other skills in the
world, just because you know there is a way to do a thing better,
doesn’t mean that you can do the thing better. Skill comes with
correct knowledge put to use and practiced over time. What use is
there knowing a tool exists and even owning it, if you never get the
inspiration that it’s now the right time for that tool?
Wisdom
Common wisdom is only so among those who are unwise. What
most people think is common wisdom is surely not, and may be the
definition of the fallacy of proof by popularity. You only get wisdom
if everyone is guessing independently. If everyone can see everyone
else’s guesses along the way, it’s worse, not better. This is because
it’s easier to determine that something is right, even if it truly is not
right, when other people concur. There is more wisdom in small
crowds and more ignorance in larger mobs. True wisdom is when
one’s intelligence has been applied to a body of knowledge over a
long enough time, forcing one’s own independent derivative, and is
in congruence enough with the underlying situation of the world that
you have a very strong mental boat, high sailing effectively down
river. The wise person is usually kind a loner and not that powerful,
but just knows or can predict what is likely to happen if you do a
certain thing.
The wisdom of crowds and ignorance of mobs
You only get wisdom if everyone is guessing independently. If
everyone can see everyone else’s guesses, its worse, not better.
What is Wisdom?
Wisdom is when your intelligence has been applied to a body of
knowledge over a long enough time, and is in congruence enough
with the underlying situation of the world that you have a very
strong boat floating, high sailing the right way down river.
What most people think is common wisdom is surely not, and
may be the definition of the fallacy of proof by popularity.
The wise person is usually kind of alone and not that powerful,
but just knows what is likely to happen if you do a certain thing.
We need to direct intellect to more motivation, belief, discipline based
things
The reason Uber was able to revolutionize, or rather create, a new
industry that served the same purpose the taxi industry did and at
much lower cost, was because there was a shit load of unused
resources sitting around (taxis aimlessly idling, waiting for nearby
passengers, for example). There were people and cars that could
drive, and there were roads with space, and everything was ready,
but the glue was missing. The glue that was required was an app that
put people that wanted rides together with people that could give
rides. And so, what is the problem that we currently have in the get-
shit-done world?

We’ve got tons and tons and tons of unused resources, which
is the ability for human beings to actually do shit. What’s missing?
Well, it’s not more knowledge. We don’t need more knowledge, we
have too much knowledge. It’s all free, it’s available 24/7, it’s all the
best it’s ever been and you are using none of it. Who cares? You
learn more? Great, now, there’s just more stuff that you know, that
you’re still not using. What we need is a human desire based, belief
based, motivation based, discipline based, glue, a binder that bridges
the gap between knowing all the stuff that we could do and actually
doing it. No amount of shoving facts into people’s heads is getting
that job done.
Processing Power Overhead
A word to describe what you’ve learned multiplied by your brain power
There should be a single word to describe what you’ve learned
multiplied by how powerful your brain is. If we have a good enough
understanding of how our consciousness works to separate
intelligence from knowledge, then surely we must see that either one
by itself is worthless, or that benefits can only be realized when the
two are combined. Need we invent a new word for applied
intelligence over time? Like power is energy multiplied by time?
Mental power shall be intelligence applied to gathering and
synthesizing new knowledge over time.
Being Correct
Knowing when you’re right or wrong
Being correct and knowing whether you’re right or wrong about a
thing is super important, because if you think you’re right and you’re
not, you will stop learning. You’ll continue to remain wrong and
you’ll force yourself into a conversation, depriving the person who is
right the significance that they should get socially, and their ability
to influence others further. Instead it will be replaced with your

misguided ignorance. Thus, if you want to be right about things, you
not only need to do work to be right, but you also need to do the
work of knowing whether you’re right or not. If you’re a person that
only speaks in absolutes of right and wrong, you’re already
delusional.
A much more intelligent and realistic measurement is what is
the chance that you’re right in numbers? Do you think this, if 50/50?
Or 70/30? How much time have you put in? Do you have access to
knowledge other people don’t? How many thoughts of other people
have you read? How confident should you be in your measurements?
Now, as an example, The people in this world that are most right, are
also the people that are most likely to know when they’re wrong,
continue to learn and continue to work and understand and test
themselves empirically to see whether they actually got it or not.

This is evident everywhere. For example, there was once a
publication that said “If you get an AIDS test and you get a positive
result and the test is 95% accurate, how likely are you to have
AIDS?” They give this test to all kinds of people and it’s actually so
misunderstood that it’s called the false positive paradox.

It’s called paradox not because paradoxes actually exist; it’s
called paradox because people’s understanding of the world is so
poor and so often at odds with the actual world that we decide to call
those things that we commonly get wrong paradoxes. A paradox
exists because humans’ perception of reality is so commonly
inaccurate in regards to this specific thing, we call that a paradox.
There are a couple other definitions, but for the way it’s being used
here, it’s accurate.

Do some research on Bayes theorem, the false positive
paradox, the prosecutor’s fallacy and the more advanced scientific
understanding, which dictates how sometimes there’s this thing
called specificity and there a thing called accuracy, and how they’re
different.
Accuracy is a probability on how likely it is to give you the
knowledge that a thing is there when it’s actually there. Specificity is
how likely the thing is to tell you that it’s not there when it’s not
there. You’ll get it wrong in both directions. Sometimes it’ll be there
and you won’t catch it, therefore your test is less accurate.
Sometimes you’ll think it’s there and it’s really not and sometimes
it’s not there, but you think it is. You end up with this set of four: is
it really there or not; did we really think it’s there or not? And then
after looking at that table of four, you’ve got to do the math for each
one of those sections and depending on how your question is phrased
you can derive those answers that you’re looking for. None of those
previous examples went as deep into false positive, false negatives
and understanding values specificity, accuracy. That was the most
advanced actual executable useful knowledge of it. It was more
advanced than the prosecutor’s fallacy. It was more advanced than
the false positive paradox. It was what Scivive found to be the most
useful world war application of the knowledge that can from an in
depth understanding of Bayes theorem. If you just see Bayes
theorem sitting there on a piece of paper, good luck deriving
meaning out if that shit; you have to know what the abbreviations
mean. And in Wikipedia, the abbreviations aren’t well defined and
yet you have to find out what those variables, what those Greek
letters actually mean.
Knowledge that makes you less certain

Scivivalists don’t like interesting knowledge that makes you less
certain. You should inherently love the feeling of progress and
excellence, and that only comes with certainty. If you don’t know
why the right thing is right - you don’t really know it’s the right
thing. If you think you know the best burger in the city, but have
only visited three places, you don’t know the best burger.
IQ
Smarts are genetic
If mental illness can be inherited, why not mental wellness, or
superiority? Schizophrenia has about 80% concordance amongst
twins, but it was once thought to be bad parenting.
IQ
Kinetic ability vs potential ability (should reduce the fear/hatred
of differences in IQ)
People overestimate the value of Intelligence in comparison
to motivation, delayed gratification. How many people do you
living up to their potential? Is it because they don’t know what
to do, or because they won’t do what they should? If the
difference in results is traction, not horsepower, then don’t
worry so much about someone’s larger or smaller motor.
Cascading advantage
People underestimate the value of small changes in some
types of intelligence. They cascade. If you learn how to learn
faster, or better, it cascades across all the new learning.
Imagine a bookshelf vs a stack of books. Some people develop
tricks early on that are the shelves.
Hit a golf ball a little crooked and see how far off course it
ends up once it has travelled a few hundred yards.
Different is better
This social programming to search for equality amongst
humans ignores the value of evolution, competition,

meritocracy, and the resultant emergent fitness and excellence
that results. Different, sometimes better, sometimes worse, is a
requirement for robustness and progress.
Get higher resolution date
Measure mental ability more like physical ability. Look at
the detail measured in the NFL combine:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine
Making a good IQ test
When you create an IQ test, you use specific strategies to
avoid cultural bias, and measure useful traits, like memory,
speed, visualization, rotating objects in one’s mind, etc. Why
not just declare the results by category. The test maker knew
what he was measuring. There’s no reason to mush it all
together.
Max and min IQ for jobs
Few people realize that you can actually be turned down for a job
for being too smart! This happens all the time in police forces around
the united states.

Creativity
Humor but not funny
Funny stuff is funny because it doesn’t make sense. Creative
ideas are new and interesting, but not funny, because they work.

They cause you to feel awe and inspiration more than giggles.
They’re related, but one becomes reality, and the other fantasy,
unless it’s a prank, then it’s real.
The amateur imitates what the master improves
Quote by Richard
Capture all your ideas!
Don’t get yourself into too much trouble with rabbit holes. If
you’re smart and fast, you realize that everything is really related to
everything else, and that everything can be learned from and applied
everywhere else, and that there’s an entire world ripe for
improvement out there. You come up with basically a million great
ideas, and the art is to just get them all captured and sort them later,
so that is what you’ll learn to do automatically over time, if you
practice. Don’t be afraid to capture a ton of very rough ideas and
adjust them later.
Negative space. What’s not there? Inductive and deductive logic.
“ You see things; and you say, ‘ Why? ’ But I dream things that never
were; and I say, ‘ Why not? ’”.
From https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy (MISATTRIBUTED, however
popularized)
Try things that are old somewhere else, but new here. (Invent)
Trying ideas that work on one thing, on other things.
You may sometimes see things and ask, “Why?” But you could
instead focus on dreaming up things that never were, and ask
yourself, “Why not?” Additionally, you can try (re)inventing ideas
that are old, applied to one field, but are new or untested in other
unrelated areas or fields. Try experimenting with things that
currently work, and mold them into other new areas or aspects of
life. Cross-ventions, if you will.

Proof of work and signaling theory

You could have invented proof of work for
Bitcoin, or CAPTCHA (Completely Automated
Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
Apart) for websites, you must have a phone number
to sign up for a Gmail account, because they are all
proofs of work that verify honest communication or
identity. These are the same proofs of work that
animals use to pretty up their “mating area” or
perform their mating dance or display those cool
colors that say, “Hey I ’ m poisonous, so don ’ t eat
me ”.

This could be used to generate all kinds of
antispam, and useful social inventions, if the
effective evolved principle was experimented
with to apply it different places in the real
world.
Location, speed, size, combination, color, material, sound,
payment plans
Take what works one place, and see if it works another
place. Globalization is one of the simplest forms of this.
If a hotdog stand does well in Chicago, maybe it will
work in Shanghai. In that model, you just changed the
location. Maybe you keep location, but change packaging
color instead. Or, maybe you carbonate it, you get the
idea. If something works in one area of life, it’s very
common for it to work in other areas, too.

TLDR: What useful and effective evolved strategies
can be exported to other disciplines and great gains
received?
Is not the feedback system in eBay a digital execution
of what we have in normal human to human relationships
of “trust”. Mind you, the eBay account that you’re
giving your “trust” to, has no face, never invites you to its

the same reasons that it works for human on human
communication.
Improve on things that are not new, but known good. (Iterate)
This is the meaning of the phrase Artists imitate, masters steal.
Tropes
If it hasn’t been done in a book or a movie, then it may have
never happened at all. Whatever you’re thinking, whatever you
are experiencing, it’s very likely someone in one of these
fictional worlds has gone through something almost the same
as you. You can learn from what they learned from, or you
could meet the author and see what insights he might have into
the situation, because he’s obviously put some thought into it
to make a story out of it.
Once you see that all new events are kind of the same
happenings over and over with little twists on them, you can
export tactics from situations you know how to handle well to
other situations you didn’t know you to handle, by discovering
they were structurally almost the same.

When you should worry about creativity
You must build off of greatness, rather than try to create your
own greatness, to catch up, and then try and build off your own. You
cripple yourself by not catching up to where the world already is.
Greatness rarely emerges from a vacuum. When should you make
your own martial art? Probably after you’ve learned a few others,
when you will get more out of yourself than you will by leaching
others creativity. Similarly, when should you write your own music?
Listening to a variety of already existing music would be a good
place to start. If you tried to write music without ever having heard
any, you would have to reinvent the chords themselves, but that
work has already been done for you in existing compositions.
Creative Ingredients
Perfect pitch means you can hear a sound and figure out instantly
how to create that sound. I would say that food would have
something similar. When you take food, do you know how to make
that flavor? You can also kind of relate it to dance. If you see
someone do a dance move on TV, can you do that dance move and
how long would it take you to try? You’ll find that only some people
can, and most people cannot.

That’s the difference between ingredients and finished output. If
you know how to dance and can break a dance set into its little
pieces, then you now have those ingredients and you can combine
them into a new and beautiful thing. Just like painting, and brushes
and canvas are just like words. So, if you take a beautiful phrase or
sentence, and then you inspect the words contained within, does that
mean you can go create a new amazing sentence out of those words?
Well, maybe, maybe not. There’s a place in this world for beautiful
sentences, and then there’s a place for people that can create them.
There’s a place for people that can create movies and there’s a place
for people to watch them. The universals that Scivival is most
addicted to that allow one to create new things are surely not even of
interest to anyone else unless they want to create new things
themselves. There are a lot of people that are happy to eat without
watching the butchering of the animal.

Shower thoughts & freeing up the mind for creativity
Shower thoughts - how odd is it, that the most resonant
name for the idea of unique things you think of is shower
thoughts? Why is it that these things occur so often in the
shower and so rarely in other places? Scivive maintains that we
have a whole lot of great processing power in these great brains
of ours, and that somewhere along the line one of our great
ancestors someone started running their brain constantly.
Instead of only solving problems that were readily apparent,
they started solving problems that didn’t exist yet. In the
animal world, that is basically what play is, you’re getting the
training and practice that you need, without having to risk your
life to get it. That’s what imagination and deep thought is for
human beings. It’s our version of animal play, it’s what makes
us more effective when the time comes, and often we can even
the situation where our creative thinking will pay off. It’s not
just the outcome from the environment, i.e. we change our
environment to suit us more often that we change ourselves to
match our environment. Is anyone out there still wiping their
ass with leaves?
Shower thoughts are really cool because they are more
creative than what you would normally think of; it actually
broadens the range of inputs you are using to synthesize new
ideas, which is what creativity is. Your environment greatly
affects the creative output of your mind, because your mind is
basically trying to pre-calculate routines that might appear so
that it’s responsively faster if those routines occur.
That is what part of what Déjà vu could be. Your brain
already pre-calculated a thing that might have happened a long
time ago when you weren’t noticing, then it actually happened
and you’re like – “Hey wait a sec, I kind of recognize this
shit.”
Shower thoughts are broader, because the range that we
use for our creativity is actually limited by our surroundings.
For instance, if we’re in a social setting around a lot of people,
our brains would try to optimize the relations between people,
the environment, and the posture. There are so many social
things that go on in a social setting that occupy your mind, like
trying to understand what other people are saying, trying to
educate them, tell them things etc. It’s very consuming to the
mind, so when you are in the shower you probably don’t have
music; you probably don’t have to think where to go next, or
people you are trying to impress. It allows you to free your
mind to create and synthesize new ideas using a broad range of
inputs that can be a lot more random. This is because they’re
not being refined or restricted to the same content matter that
exists during the rest of the day, whether we are being
influenced by work or school or by a lover or any other type of
social setting.
Creative Excellence
Creative mix
If you are a creative, or a dedicated, person and just will throw
lots of shit at the wall; if you identify what excellence is, the

components that make it up and then just mess around in the area
and mix things together, whether it be different sounds, the correct
beats, or different colors, shapes and textures for art, and then you
mix and transmute those into what might be an okay-looking form
that hasn’t been well marketed yet. Then you can create quality
production and any creative art that didn’t require insane amounts of
training such as actually playing an instrument instead of sampling
it, singing instead of having someone else sing or sampling it,
actually using digital art tactics or the assistance of others to execute
an idea visually or animate.
You can create beautiful things even if you can’t specifically
do the thing yourself. Many books are written by multiple parties;
there’s an editor, there’s the illustrator that does the cover, there’s
the person that writes the text and sometimes there’s expert
consultants that you go to, to see whether these things are expert on
or done properly.
All you need to know is what excellence looks like, mix it up,
mash it up and through that exercise you might discover a new form
of excellence that people didn’t see previously. Now, you’ve not
only permutated something beautiful, but you’ve also added to the
science, which would amplify and allow others to go and further
expedite beauty based on your new archetype, and that has
exponentially multiplying effects throughout time.
Hard to train people to be creative & feedback loops
Part of the reason why it’s so hard to train people to be creative is
that there’s no feedback loop by which they can, without someone
else’s trusted input, be told that what they did actually was
worthless. But, if you’re building a website, and the website doesn’t

load, you know it’s garbage - it’s not up for debate. If you draw a
graphic, you might think it is great, even if to the rest of the world it
is not. Having aesthetic understanding inside your brain as a human,
even that is pretty common, which is why you don’t see people
walking around wearing garbage bags, usually. It’s because people
think that shit looks ugly, feels bad, looks bad, smells bad, and
sounds bad. They have aesthetic internal programming which tells
them when something is weak. But, the more advanced the creative
topic is, the harder and harder that feedback loop gets.

You choose an infrastructure. You choose a lifestyle. You
choose a way to write a passage, a sentence, a paragraph, and you
have no realistic way of knowing how far percentage-wise you are
into the greatness that could exist. Therefore, it’s hard to know when
you should stop going down a path and work on the next thing. It’s
hard to know whether what you’ve built is the best it can be or not.
The more creative a complicated your work gets, the harder it is to
find a feedback loop to help the world train your output. A feedback
loop says, “Hey, that’s good, do more of that!” or “That doesn’t
work well, do less of that.” The quicker and more obvious those
things are, the easier it is to path against your own will, or with your
own will, to greatness. You may sometimes get these creative ideas
where you can’t even generate your own internal, reliable opinion on
whether or not it’s menial, let alone search for an external trusted
opinion. Now you can’t test it, and you end up with more variables
and it is much more of a function of your original search space, your
creativity, than it is your ability to properly path through that search
space.
You may see a lot of great software come out of America,
maybe not because they’re better developers, but because they might
be more creative. Maybe they are more aware of what is possible

than someone that can just do the one thing that they are aware of
well, but botch a lot of things up because the things that weren’t
specified properly, they get done wildly wrong. But a creative
person, as he’s coding it and doing it imperfectly, sees that it kind of
isn’t what you should have wanted, and then lets you know, “Hey,
you shouldn’t have wanted that, so
I’m going to build it differently. Thank me later.”
The importance of feedback loops
Part of the reason why you should understand how important
feedback
Loops are is the concept of the book The Design of Everyday
Things written by Mr. Norman. The book illustrates good user
interface, and good usability, which is basically another way of
saying “human beings use it properly to the best of its ability and
enjoy doing so.” That mandates two things: one, that the available
ways to use the thing are declared to you so that you can experiment
with it and see which ways work, and which ways don’t, and that’s
the feedback loop. So the two core principles, and one should check
to see if there’s more, are declaring the options, using the options,
and having feedback that you can understand.
Synthesis
The important part is the synthesis, this is the highest and best
application of the human ability and spirit, to create something
which has never before existed and is excellent. Synthesis is the
mental sex which produces beautiful thought offspring.

Trichotomy
“A trichotomy is a three-way classificatory division. Some
philosophers pursued trichotomies.” - Wikipedia
More at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotomy_(philosophy)
Wavelenghts of creavitivity

If it’s smart or effective to write drunk and edit sober, then it’s
possible that certain types of thought have a frequency at which
certain types of mind states resonate those frequencies easier. Maybe
being tipsy restricts depth and enhances creativity in some ways.
Maybe being on downers affects people in one way, being on
hallucinogens does something different, and Speed does another
thing. It’s therefore an interesting analogy to make that thoughts are
like frequencies, and that they resonate inside the chambers of one’s
mind differently based on the shape, size and medium of density of
air inside the chamber. Not the real chamber, but, in theory, the
virtual composition of a person’s mind.
To expand further upon that creativity idea, when you measure
a speaker, you have what are called Thiele-Small parameters, which
measure the electrical and mechanical residents, weight, electrical
motor force, magnet force, and if you have all those numbers, you
can predict how that driver, that speaker will act in an enclosure, and
how it will respond to frequencies, especially the musical kind. That
type of Thiele-Small parameterization could also exist amongst
intelligent beings for searched depth, searched width. How far do
you go down a path before you decide it’s a dead end? How many
offshoot paths do you try, what value do you give to paths that seem
related? A lot of Thiele-Small parameter speaker optimization, Al
and human creativity and idea searching are related.
Unique insights
For creativity exercises, you could try changing the color of your
environment, temperature, location, space, focus, posture or mind
focus.
What part of your body are you focusing on? You could use
archetype experiments, where you pretend you’re a king, pretend
you’re a poor person, pretend you’re angry, pretend you’re happy,

pretend you’re all kinds of different shit to get different perspectives
on a thing. After doing all that, maybe you’ll have some new and
unique insights that are still your own.
Logic
Frameworks
Math
Great math learning resources
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14161876
How is advanced math supposed to be useful to the average
person? Of course basic math is important in everyday life, but
hard to profit from. Is there a shortage of people that know
basic addition and subtraction? Can’t wolframalpha.com
literally answer basically any question you properly type into
it? How are you supposed to profit off of some knowledge that
is so widespread and has been for thousands of years, and now
is literally done fast and instantly for free for anyone that has
Internet access and a browser? Is it important? Yes, but only as
far as it serves things that are actually important. We need
more people sticking parts together with human ideas as the
glue, let the grunts and machines do the grunt work. Do what
the machines can’t. Be the middleware. There are only a select
few occupations that would require one to know advanced
mathematical theory For example, statistics and algebra are
important for business and machine learning.
Frameworks and organizational structure
Which sex is better for breastfeeding? The answer is clearly
women. Conversely, which is better at fist fighting? Well,
probably the guy. Which one belongs on top? Nobody belongs
on top. That would be using the wrong framework. You’re not
supposed to have such a simplistic relationship organization
between utterly complex, utterly un-simplistic things that have

been constantly changing, always evolving different and
different places relationship.
Looking on the other side of the coin
Some have found more value than usual in looking in what
is the “Not” thing, the polar opposite. For instance, anytime
you look at a question, you can look at the not question. It’s a
little hard to explain, but there’s a natural example in the
programming of humans with something called frustration.
This helps dictate that they halt what they are doing and go do
another thing, because otherwise they could just get stuck in a
loop and keep trying the thing until they died of hunger, their
arms fell off, or whatever other failure mode they hit. The
example consisted of several options. You could either get
them to stop by hating what they’re doing, or by really liking
the next thing, and from a programming perspective it’s much
easier to hate the one thing you have obviously in front of you,
than to be drawn by the vastness of everything else out there. It
would be too hard and abstract to find a trigger in everything
else out there to cause a halt.
Zoom out for first principals
Because chunking and nesting ideas is so powerful, it’s
super useful to zoom out really far and make what you’re
looking at really small.
This way you get all these new little hook points you can
anchor the data to in your mind. It’s sort of like seeing the
forest as a forest instead of only seeing lots of trees.
Advanced logic
Advanced practitioners of logic, and how to have the best grasp of
logic
It’s rather unfortunate that when you analyze some of the
most advanced practitioners of logic in history, their lives left

much to be desired. You take Wittgenstein, suicidal. Gay is
derogatory, but it definitely indicates some kind of off-
programming from what’s normal. Hit kids and women, and
was a little bit violent towards kids if they didn’t get their math
right. He changed his view on religion a couple times. How
does that happen? You either got it right or you didn’t, you
don’t really get the luxury of switching between one stupid
thing and another thing, unless your mind is one that is forced
into understanding the unexplainable. Some minds tend to fill
in the blanks with (false?) logic.
Just to give you an idea about how respected
Wittgenstein was, he actually was a student to Bertrand Russel.
Bertrand Russel admitted his superiority and it basically
changed his life when Russel was talking and Wittgenstein
criticized, and at that moment he knew he’d never be able to
add to the science any longer, because there was someone else
who just had it better, and what he was doing was kind of
inaccurate compared to this other guy’s version of things.
When you look at the productivity the guy had, he only wrote a
children’s book, he released like three or four things in his
whole lifetime, and then, one of the most widely regarded good
things that ever came out of him had to come out of his notes
after he was dead.

XX – Too many he’s, hims, and he’s again. Use more
names, hard to follow who is who a little bit

You even see other people, like Schopenhauer, who
literally had to come up with a logical framework to describe
why he says that

Aestheticism was great, but then he hoarded shit and was
more hedonistic. His excuse, his logic was that “to be a
philosopher, you need only build ideas, not be the ideas”. You
can sculpt a beautiful sculpture without being beautiful, and
you can be beautiful without being a sculpture. That was a nice
excuse, but most people, I think, see that if you don’t use what
you claim to know and what you claim is amazing, you greatly
reduce the confidence in what you’re saying is true.

Just to give you an idea about how respected Wittgenstein
was, he actually was a student to Bertrand Russel. Bertrand
Russel straight up admitted his superiority and it basically
changed his life when he was talking to him and Wittgenstein
criticized him, and at that moment he knew he’d never be able
to add to the science any longer, because there was someone
else who just had it better, and what he was doing was kind of
inaccurate compared to this other guy’s version of things.
When you look at the productivity the guy had, he only wrote a
children’s book, he released like three or four things in his
whole lifetime, and then, one of the most widely regarded good
things that ever came out of him had to come out of his notes
after he was dead.

To have the best grasp of logic, one of the best grasps of
logic that the world has ever seen in the history of mankind,
and yet seems to further execute logic in your own life so
ineffectively, is the idea of God. It’s somewhat like football
players; they’re amazing at what they do, but then in their
personal lives and their financial lives, they’re definitely not as
good. Maybe there should be some other word for a person that
accurately uses what they know to the highest and best use and

outcome of its possibility, extending not only to the one focus,
but to all aspects of their lives. Maybe that’s wisdom. Scivive,
however argues that wisdom is not enough. I mean, you never
picture the wise person as young, vital and fit, nor loved and
popular. As stated earlier, the wise person is usually thought of
as being kind of alone, and not that powerful, although he
knows what is likely to happen if you do a certain thing.
Perhaps what Schopenhauer said was accurate. You can be
an amazing sculptor yet remain ugly, which is kind of a bad
analogy because using logic and building logic are very
similar, whereas looking pretty and sculpting pretty things have
nothing in common.. They don’t touch, they’re not related.
You must simply understand what may be commonly
recognized as pretty and be able to duplicate that. It’s actually,
that particular excuse that Schopenhauer had for living a life at
odds with what he taught is the highest and best life you could
live. Maybe it didn’t accurately explain away his culpability or
responsibility.
Correlation causation(More Info)
Correlation isn’t causation
More at: http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations
Illogical Pattern finding will lead you away from truth; Correlation
causation
Education regarding correlation and causation – There was an
important lesson that was taught in an extremely memorable way,
and it was probably one of the best lessons one can learn in college
entirely. It was a trivia question that my sociology teacher gave me.
It goes as follows:
So, you’re in a city, and one year the crime rate of the city
doubles and the number of people who attend church also doubles,

what can you say about what’s going on in that city? A lot of people
would say that the new church goers are committing crimes. In fact,
wouldn’t it be easier if you noticed that the population of the city
doubled as well? Therefore, really nothing has changed in terms of
ratio. There were twice as many church goers and twice as many
crimes committed simply because the population doubled.
Just because two things happen at the same time surely does
not mean that they caused one another. Being stumped for that
moment and not knowing what could have caused those two things
to go up at the same time really drove home the point that the third
(or more) cause is always out there and quite commonly overlooked.
Two things that seem to be dependent on each other are actually both
caused by a third thing - appears all the time logically. Scivive
believes that these serendipitous feelings and pattern-finding feelings
are yet another effect of that third cause discovery that third causes
are probably much more common than we think they are.
Do not confuse correlation with causation
All the cool shit in the world that’s the smartest shit in the world,
you don’t understand, because it’s the smartest shit in the world. It
takes people a lifetime of dedication and education to even get to
understanding the shit that’s already out there to have the hopes of
building on top of it. It is an unfortunate consequence of confusing
causation with correlation that made up bullshit that has no value at
all, is also insanely complex. Unfortunately therefore, you are not
able to efficiently use the complexity of a topic to let you know
whether it is accurate or whether you should learn about it, or care
about it. A lot of people take something that’s hard to understand,
like quantum physics, and try to use it outside of the realm where it
is useful and apply to emotions or feelings or business.
Reasoning

Critical thinking means judgmental thinking
Critical thinking isn’t called critical because it’s required, it just
means judgmental. This is the danger of words that have two
meanings that are very different. For instance, a patient critical
condition versus it’s critical that you do a thing.
How to catch Fraudulent statistics
“Benford’s law: In any collection of statistics, a given statistic has
roughly a 30% chance of starting with the digit 1.”

Richard ’ s comment: That’s how you can catch fraudulent
numbers being generated by people instead of reality.
From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponymous_laws>
This is how you catch fakers of data.
Benford’s law of controversy: Passion is inversely proportional to
the amount of real information available.
Avoid The Downsides to having just one innacurate idea
The downside to having one inaccurate idea is, if you believe that
the unborn have rights, it is pretty justifiable to go prosecute
abortionists. That’s unacceptable! One can’t really know of a way to
disprove that idea. The first wrong idea facilitates more wrong ideas
here. It’s better to not have the wrong idea in the first place. Unborn
people are not people. It’s not everyone job to use all of their sperm
and eggs to make you happy, Mr. Advisor guy. That guy just has to
understand that the unborn aren’t people and do not have rights, and
even if they did have rights and they were being abridged, killing the
would-be parents, who have already been born isn’t the right
solution. Christopher Hitchens quoted someone else saying that “For

bad men to do bad things is quite simple, but to get a good man to do
bad things, you really need religion.”

Calibrate your estimate on what you understand properly
The point being, if you are very good at knowing things, but very
bad in your estimates at what you understand or don’t understand
properly, you will harm yourself; you will stop studying things that
you should have studied more and you will mislead the education of
the world. On the other hand, if you’re super good at knowing what
you know and what you don’t know, you’ll probably actually also
harm yourself because you’ll be afraid to say anything ever, because
you’re only comfortable speaking with an unreasonable degree of
specificity. You might be the kind of guy who’s incapable of
suggesting what book someone reads because you’re deciding
whether knowledge can even exist? How do we know what we really
know? Are we really just the simulation? You’re too smart for your
own good. You’ve become ineffective.

Why is it that so much of the popular culture is influenced and
created by those that put their balls in their hands, get the job done
and are willing to be wrong? Because it’s so important that you’d be
better off getting an 80% right and eating shit 20% of the time than
making no impact in the world, only saying one thing once ever in
your whole life, but being right about it. Unfortunately, everyone
else already knew that because the guys that were 80% right already
said it 50 times before you got around to it.
Increasing your understanding removes limiting beliefs
The funny thing is, when you don’t understand an idea good
enough, you think you know everything. Lots of 20-year olds think
they know everything.
Your capacity to understand complex things; The truly hardest take
dedication/time/emotion
In a world where intelligences and interests fit on a nice bell
curve, the vast majority of people don’t even have the capacity to
understand the hardest things. Of those that do, the truly hardest
things take more than capacity, they take the dedication of time and
emotion to excel at. You can’t be too good at too many things, you
run out of time. You really only have time to be a master of a few
things. Thus, the vast majority of people will have many false beliefs
about many things, not because they’re stupid, or malicious, but
because life is hard and finite. When you have to hand over your
decision making to experts, because they’re the only ones with a
hope of being right, then whether you are correct or not basically
comes down to whether you chose to believe the right expert or not.
This is a choice that the super intelligent must make very similar to
those less intelligent, we all must defer to the experts on tons and
tons of things every day.
Capture the prerequisites for bigger and better understanding
The ability for someone to understand a great idea is
unfortunately tied to their ability to have created the idea on their
own. Similar to the way that burgers can’t get much better because
we’re limited by our taste buds, it’s the same reason that you can
share something amazing with them, but they don’t have the tools to
understand why they should be amazed. You don’t know what you
have unless you built it yourself.

Human Intellect has not changed, knowledge transfer has just increased
in quality

Human Intellect has not changed; knowledge transfer has just
increased in quality. It unfortunate that you can read reports and
documents from 100 or 1000 years ago and could believe they were
written today. The people of the time had such sharp minds and such
thinking abilities that it’s a tragedy they didn’t have access to the
same tools and resources we have today. If the biologists are right,
the capacity of the human mind hasn’t really increased very much at
all in the couple of thousand years since English and cities have
existed. It’s quite a wonder to believe that what separates us from
them isn’t that we are better people, but that we have stored so much
energy in knowledge passed down from generation to generation that
the lives we live today are massively better than the lives they lived,
and it’s not because we are smarter!
Perhaps just more collectively knowledge containing.
Analogies are the best tools for understanding - Use them!
It is said that analogy is the most powerful of all learning tools.
Analogy is where you take new ideas and show how they’re just like
other things; glove is to hand like sock is to foot, square is to cube
like circle is to cylinder. Regardless of all those differences, because
you understand the concept of a door, you can really quickly
understand and operate all of these, because analogies are awesome.
They’re all different in ways that don’t really matter, and similar in
the ways that they need to be for you to kick ass at remembering
them. By the way, it’s common to see analogies as large components
of IQ tests. Therefore, if finding and using analogies is something
you can get better at, then you will show a heightened IQ score on
many IQ tests. You’ll probably be better off with a heightened
understanding of the world, than yet another test score to brag about,
but it’s a free bonus to an otherwise already awesome behavior.

The power of analogy; the more you understand about the
world in one area, the more you understand about the world in all the
other areas, as long as you learn how to apply the analogy and as
long as you learn how to apply the framework somewhere else. It
may not increase what they call in the study of intelligence, your Big
G, your general intelligence, how well you do on an IQ test, but you
can have Big G without ever learning a language. You can have Big
G in intelligence without ever learning how to do anything..
Less complicated ways that lead to understanding
If you want to learn how to speed read and speed while retaining
much of the info and actually understand it, then you’re studying
common patterns that you can apply other places to employ the
power of analogy. You’re using tools that shift the words in front of
your eyes so that you don’t have to move your eyes in traditional
fashion from left to right across the screen. Those things are proven
to work. Everything else that you study that attempts to “teach you to
speed read,” they actually just make you think you understand more,
but in reality you’re smoking through the pages reading a lot faster,
not absorbing a lot faster, basically throwing more information in the
garbage. However, at the end of throwing all that information in the
garbage, you think you know better than you did. Then, they test it.
It’s been said before and Scivive will say it here now, the world does
not need speed reading. The world needs speed understanding,
faster, more complete comprehension. Since understanding isn’t
something that happens better at high speeds, increasing the speed at
which we understand things isn’t the right solution. Utilizing an
inferior method of understanding faster is crap compared to finding a
better way of understanding, which is inherently faster, not because
you’re doing it faster, but because it is a better analogy, a better
example, a simpler, less complicated way of understanding a thing.

As an example, if you say that the burden of proof lies with the
person that makes the outrageous statement, well that’s one way of
understanding, that’s a good way to understand the world. The
simpler thing is more likely to be accurate than the more complex
thing, because it involves less moving parts to make it happen. Of
both of two explanations exist, a more complicated and a less
complicated one, both accurately define the way a thing can happen,
the less complicated one’s more likely to be more accurate. (Or
really, less wrong. Less complications leave room for less error). It’s
a little bit esoteric, it’s a little bit hard to understand.
Another guy comes along, Bertrand Russell, and he has a
funny little saying called Bertrand’s tea kettle. What’s that? He says,
listen. One could say that between us and the moon, or us and the
sun, orbiting, is a tea kettle. And if you can’t disprove that, then
we’ll just have to take my assumption that it exists. It’s an example
of proof through absurdity.
This may not be an exact fit
This is maybe not an exact fit, but you could say it’s the power of
analogy. When you learn martial arts there are certain moves where
if you miss a couple frames, you’re weak from a couple frames. You
would only know about how many frames a move costs you if
you’ve studied video games in the fighting genre. When you design
such games and you give each character a certain set of moves that
he can do, it’s like a giant abstraction on top of the game Rock-
paper-scissors; this move beats that move, but not this move, and
then you’ve got timing relationships. If you try to charge up one
move, then you’re weak and vulnerable during this period of time.
You can, though, bait someone to try and take advantage of that
weakness, and then immediately take another action to counter it.

Understand that executing ideas in businesses, or in punches
and kicks take an amount of time to execute. Your opposition, unless
you’re a perfect negotiator or fighter, can tell through your stance,
timing and what you do with your eyes and where you put your
weight, what you might throw. This is because they’ve seen it
before. Whatever decisions you make in life - education, fighting,
you’re going to have down time, you’re going to be telegraphing
your intention to people that are watching. Let’s say you’re at an
auction and want to bid on a couch, and you tell everyone in the
room what you’re willing to pay. You just kind of screwed yourself
on the price. Let’s say you want to buy one whole street of real estate
to go tear the things down and build a bigger piece of real estate, and
you don’t hide the fact that you’re buying up piece by piece. If
people begin to figure out that that’s what you’re trying to do, they
can ask you for a shit load more money than their house would be
worth by itself, because their house is now a requirement for you to
complete your set that you’ve already invested so much into. They
can charge you double or triple the market value of their house,
because you need it more and it’s worth the double or triple to you,
solely because they were aware of your intention. Try playing
Monopoly and purchasing Park Place from another player, when
they know you are holding Boardwalk.
Visual Diagrams for understanding can hurt you
The reasons that the vast majority of things that you learn in
school and work with and use in your day-to-day life, you never end
up referencing in some cool geometric, like formula or intelligence.
If you’re watching your macros as a guy that works out, do you
actually reference the food pyramid, never; you have the macros just
memorized. If you’re doing math, do you ever go back and look at
the unit circle to decide how to do your calculus – pretty much
never. These contrivances of people thinking that some triangle or

pyramid might add to people’s understanding actually tends to hurts
people’s understanding.
Using the wrong visualizations screws up our understanding of
ideas
Serial Pyramid Pillars Totem pole instead of pyramids.
Pyramids indicate volume difference. <TJ-XX - Could use an
example about Maslow’s, unless that’s already somewhere>
We are pattern finding machines - Let’s make use of it
We create patterns - that’s what music is, that’s what language is.
When a man makes love to a woman and that woman has a beautiful
child, that’s a new pattern that we created, not totally consciously.
Maybe parts of it, but we choose those traits, we chose that time, we
chose to give ourselves fully to another person. That’s where cool
people like us come from. We’re built to absorb, process, and create
virtual realities that may come true in our head. That’s what
dreaming is, that’s what imagination is, that what play is. It is us,
getting the best real world practice we can get, without greatly
endangering our lives. If you want to have the virtual, - being chased
by a killer - experience, you need only wait. It happens in a couple of
dreams that you’ll remember per year. I’m not sure the rate that you
get to have your escape the killer style dreams, but they’re useful. If
ever one day a killer’s actually chasing you, you will do slightly
better, because you’ve already pre-calculated some shit that guy
might do, and some shit that you might do. We arrive at those paths,
quicker. It’s pre-computation. It may be one source of where Deja-
vu comes from. When you experience a Déjà-vu, you accidentally
have something happen in your real life, something that you pre-
complied in your sleep or in your free time, or you subconsciously
saw in a film or subconsciously imagined happened to somebody

else and then it just brought back that memory of “Oh wow, I’ve
seen this before!”
How religions emerge
If you put a kid on an island, he’ll invent his own religion and
ritual
If you take a kid, as soon as he’s born, you put it and a robot
on an island, the robot feeds it until it can handle life on its
own, never talks to it, never teaches it anything, that kid is
going to find patterns. This is because pattern finding is useful,
and those patterns will probably turn into stories. If he ever
meets another person, he will tell those stories, and then the
opportunity for collectivism and collective benefit and
teamwork will exist. The people that believe the same stories
will group together and outperform people that don’t believe
the same shared fictions.
Thus, it’s not that religions are inherited, it’s that
religions, in isolation, would emerge for the same profitable
reasons that they always have, because pattern recognition is
useful. Memory and therefore storytelling is useful, and
working together is useful. Learning and transmitting
knowledge to another person, is done through story - the story
of imaginary futures.
Instructing is taking a pattern found to work, and sticking it in
someone else’s head
What is instructing? Instructing is taking a pattern found to
work, and sticking it in someone else’s head. If you imagine a
world that doesn’t actually exist and we just stick it in your
head, then in that other alternate world that you can say is
current or past, whatever, it doesn’t abide by the rules of time
because it doesn’t really exist. It only exists in your mind, the
details are up to you.

That same pattern finding, storytelling and collective
profit will cause religions to emerge. This is because the access
time and processing required to generate a bungled story that is
cool to tell, cool to share, and cool to gather behind, is a much
lower bar and standard than something that we haven’t even
been able to find with all of our advanced technology. It’s cool,
compelling, easy to tell, easy to follow, and maybe seems to be
a factually, scientifically accurate and true story. We’ve got a
lot of cool stories everyone believes. They’re all wrong and
mutually exclusive. Even if by chance, one of them was
actually right, all the other ones are still wrong. The vast
majority of religious and spiritual stories that everyone tells are
wrong by their own definitions without any other research
whatsoever, because they disagree with each other. Whichever
one’s right, all the other ones are wrong.

The threshold that pattern recognition, storytelling and
collectivism emerges in the behavior of wrong beliefs is like a
hundred times lower than something we’ve not even found yet.
Science hasn’t become a religion at all. Nobody goes to science
school on Sunday and prays to the Science God and sleeps with
or marries only other science-following chicks. It’s not a thing.
That’s why even if you find something that works, if you don’t
have all the other cool stories and side benefits to believing it,
it can’t compete with religions.
Perhaps the closest we have to that is Judaism, literally.
You’re a doctor, you’re a scientist, okay, and we’re cool with
you hooking up with our daughter. Not a doctor? Eh, not a
lawyer? Maybe you’re not what we want for our daughter.
Culturally, the Jewish people reward saving, investment, and

learning. Other cultures reward adventure, craziness, drinking,
partying, shit that is the opposite of investment. You’re
investing in the death of your liver, which isn’t really a good
investment at all. What did your liver ever do to you, except try
to keep you healthy?
The point is, emergent properties exist, and they’re not often
inherited. They would re-execute in a very similar form on
their own, because they pay profits, and the threshold of things
that have to align in order for them to emerge is so vastly lower
than the other things that we’re trying to force to emerge by
design. This is why if you got rid of all the religions in the
world, they would just reappear in slightly different forms,
because they provide a competitive advantage to their
followers, and an even more exaggerated advantage to their
preachers.
The set of things that you could misunderstand, the set of
ways that you could misunderstand a thing, is nearly infinite
compared to the very small set of ways that you could actually
understand the way that it really is. And the way that it is
really, wildly not, the million other ways that it could be, but
isn’t.
Don’t fall for correlation causation fallacy, improve your understanding
and reasoning
Don’t fall for correlation causation fallacy; improve your
understanding and reasoning. The older you get, the more things you
see and have seen, the easier it is for you to make connections. As a
result, the easier it is for you to see connections where they don’t
really exist, or where they do exist, they don’t exist in the way that

you wish they did. You find some interesting coincidences. Let’s say
you Google one topic, and then you’re going through the day and
you Google something else, and then those two things somehow
magically both relate to a third thing. What you’ll find more often
than not is that the reason that those two seemingly so distantly
related topics actually relate is all because of you - the thing that
influenced the first result, the thing that influenced the second result,
and the thing that influenced you - were all quite popular and were
pre-selected for popularity.
In summary, what you’ll find is that you’ll have more of these
feelings of serendipity the more you use Google or voice
recognition. A woman once spoke in tongues into her phone and her
phone gave her very interesting, accurate results, but she didn’t
realize that the phone didn’t have a choice. The phone was going to
give the best guess no matter what, and the best guess is always
going to give you good results. To teach her the error of her ways,
the error that she thought that there was meaning coming from the
phone even though she was speaking gibberish into it, another
person spoke gibberish into it, and it also responded with meaningful
results, because it had no choice but to attempt to give meaningful
results with each question asked. The users are the ones that tried to
pretend that something meaningful came from what was asked. In
reality, the meaning came from random chance. Some meaning had
to be output, and the users are the ones making the connection
between those two meanings - the gibberish being spoken into the
phone and the interesting, unique outcome coming out the other side.
Therefore, the more intelligent you are and the better story teller you
are, the more connections you can make, the more believable you
can make these false correlations that have no causation.
Common human misconceptions that distort understanding

making faces out of landscapes and the fronts of cars. In
photography dCe of mountain making faces out of landscapes.
Sometimes this is done on purpose in marketing. There is a reason
why 16 ounce coke bottles have the same contours as a woman’s
body; men are subconsciously attracted to it.
Knowing Thyself
Do not assume the world is as wise as you are
It’s hard to know reality, could you predict ISIS? You must not
assume the world is as wise as you, it’s not.
Know what you know, and what you don’t. Know the same of others.
The Monty Hall problem and the statistics example in that TED
talk once given, regarding rolling a dice, where everyone answers it
wrong are very telling. If everyone is working on wrong data and or
everyone is making the wrong decisions consistently, you can’t
really expect great output from persons under that influence, at least
in regards to that material. There’s merit in tying that lack of
knowledge in to understanding oneself and having some humility.
Find out your goals and the things in life that motivate you
A lot of times being a good teacher doesn’t mean that you are a
good do-er, and vice versa. They are different skill sets, being able to
do something and being subconsciously competent at it doesn’t make
you a good teacher. Being a good teacher requires pedagogic skills
that have very little to do with, for instance, the actual act of
swimming. This is the reason why even if you’re an Olympic gold
medalist, you still might make a negative coach. By definition
subconscious competence means you are quite probably a shit
teacher about it, because it’s subconscious to you! Because you don’t
know why you’re good at racecar driving, you don’t know why
you’re good at stick, you don’t know why you are a good speaker,

and to know those things would be an entirely different skill set.
Self-knowledge and self-awareness, and proper education and
motivation is an entirely separate domain, and taught as such from
being a good business man, or being a good basketball player. A
coach that can help you meet goals, and refine your objectives, and
find the golden moving feeling that motivates you in a thing, it
works in a lot of places. If you can sell one thing, you can sell nearly
anything. Maybe it was compelled when they saw someone winning
a competition. Maybe they could feel it when they felt jealous that
someone else was achieving something.
Memory
The organizing of all important things
The world is a super complicated place. You can’t listen to all the
songs at once, even radios listen to only a few stations at a time. We
have such a hard time keeping ideas in our minds that we even split
10 digit phone numbers into two sets. That’s why it helps to keep
things in easy to remember groups, and then nest the groups in each
other, deeper and deeper. Remember that overly simple
understanding is more dangerous than overly complex. Overly
complex might take a long time to digest, but digest overly simply
and you might never discover that you were missing important parts
of understanding stuff they used to think back when we didn’t know
as much about the world. Just these types of images and phrenology
images, this secondary consciousness shit is stuff we just learned
rather recently.

Dont become a memorizing machine or rely on your memory
It’s funny that you shouldn’t become a memorizing machine
because we have phones, computers and other people that do that
very least important of all mental abilities. At least, past the working
memory. You need working memory to build new ideas in your
head, but actually memory of facts and figures and things like that,
that you don’t need to instantly have. Working memory, that
memory is crap.
Mnemonic technique - USE IT
When you interrogate people with good memories, or that have
exceptional reasoning abilities, you find these common patterns of
brain usage that are not chemical. They are conscience decisions to
use your brain in a certain way, and then after you practice using it
that way enough, you’re just used to using it that way. Mnemonic
technique exists, chunking exists. Making up funny little sayings
with the first letter as something you want to remember, acronyms,
they work. “My Very Easy Method Just Shows Us Nine Planets”.
That’s a mnemonic representation of the planets in order from the
sun outward.
If it is true, that the smartest, most effective, most bad ass, non-
idiot savant people, all have little fun tricks and shortcuts they use to
make their mind work better. Wouldn’t that be a good thing to teach
people? Wouldn’t that be something that could pay dividends forever
more? The answer is certainly, yes. What do you know; mnemonic
technique has existed for thousands of years.
Using mnemonic technique lets you now what’s important so you can
take action
A common mnemonic technique is putting shit in alphabetical
order when Meeting new people. When one meets a group of people,

one could memorize their names by putting them in mind and
preferably in the real world in the order of their names. A mnemonic
technique is knowing, and a mnemonic technique is having desire. If
you have desire, it instantly lets you know what is important and
what is not. Knowing what is important, makes your memory
extremely happy. Super easy to remember what you care about! If
you love sports, it’s super easy to remember stats. If you love
gadgets, it’s super easy to remember tech. If you love books, it’s
super easy to remember a thing you read in a book. People love to
remember shit that interests them. If you are passionless and without
drive, and have no desires, well then, how is your brain supposed to
know what to put a big ass red flag next to, in order to remember?
How is it supposed to bookmark what’s important to you, if you
don’t tell it, if you don’t mention it, if you don’t let it feel it?
Using mnemonic techniques to make better sense and reduce mental
overhead
Using mnemonic techniques to make better sense and reduce
mental overhead is critical to learning and memory. As mentioned
earlier, the world does not need speed reading, it needs speedy
understanding. Speed reading is by definition the opposite of
understanding. You’re increasing the rate of the data transfer and
decreasing the horse power available to organize and understand the
data; very likely, what you’re doing is wasting your time. Now, if
you want to get a book over with really quick, you can skip the speed
reading and just look at the table of contents and pretend that you
learn something from that.

Here’s the problem, for some reason, most books’ table of
contents are completely useless! It’s unclear as to who invented this
in books lately, where an author tries to make the table of contents so
vague so as to be only useful for someone that has actually
completed reading the whole book so that they can translate your
negative vague chapter titles into something actually meaningful.
That, fellow readers, hopefully does not follow the guidelines of
good style issued by the associated press. Hopefully it doesn’t also
issue the good elements of styles advertised by Strunk & White, One
of the most prescribed for reading books in the college syllabuses of
the world, it’s like number three or four most commonly required
reading material in the syllabus of easily digitized and search
colleges. Why is this worth mention? One, for you guys out there
writing, please stop wasting people’s time with fake tables of
contents that don’t describe the contents. That’s like owning a
supermarket and no longer categorizing things by what they really
are, and randomizing which aisles and shelves the products are
located. Oh, you want Colgate toothpaste? It’s next to the milk. Or,
Crest toothpaste? It’s hidden inside the toilet cleaner section. What a
terrible idea! Good categorization, good description and good
mnemonic technique are what human beings need to make sense of
this ever more complicated and changing world..
Invent more words to spread better understanding
Inventing words is cool. It’s one of those things that are difficult
to get traction at first and once you do get the traction, you get
explosive results. It’s like a new fad diet. If your new diet doesn’t
become popular, you don’t have much impact, but if your diet does
become popular, holy shit, you’re going to change the eating habits
of a huge portion of the planet for the period of time where that little
fad diet was fad full. That’s a funny word, fad full.
Thus, if you coin new terms and have the balls and the
influence to get them to stick, you bring into the global
consciousness an easier path to execution for that thing. For instance,
there was a time where the term branding didn’t exist, and then
people figured out that it was something that worked, and branding

became a new strategy term. They assigned it a word and holy shit,
the branding thing is now all over the place.
You’re going to find that in many examples of human
wordsmithing. For example, feeling the burn is a coined term.
What’s feeling the burn? Oh, that’s when you work out real hard and
your muscles feel like their hot. Someone hears that and thinks, “Oh,
feeling the burn! That sounds good, I like that.” Now, people are
much more likely to work out until they feel a burn. So, by coining
terms and pushing them to stickiness, if they can be made to be
sticky, you further influence actual behavior. It helps to have them
sound nice, feel nice, be imaginative, have those little hooks that
make mnemonic techniques work. Then, you can for the rest of
human endeavor and for the rest of time as long as that word is used,
influence greatly the actions that people take. Scivive is a big
proponent of taking what is true and commonly known these days,
but no one ever uses it, because there’s no word for the simple
actionable action, and malign a word for it in the hopes that people
then actually do the thing they know of.
Everyone knows that science exists, but not enough
individuals learn, practice, and advance it. If we can start to advance
little chunks of useful science, then people can receive the
advantages from those discoveries.
A way to look at life choices
It’s interesting that learning “frames” can help one understand
more about the cost of movements and actions. How many frames
does it cost you to try and use a move in a game? With that
understanding, some are able to extrapolate it to business and
purchasing, and to choices that you make in your life, and to other
systems that have feedback, that change based on what you do.
Just like a fighting game. There’s another person looking at
the same screen you’re looking at, who’s trying to figure out what

you’re going to do, why you’re going to do it, anticipate you,
manipulate you, and win. In a fighting game, it’s very clear what the
goal is: to get rid of the other player’s health bar. At that point, your
opponent then loses the round. You have health remaining, you win
the round, and attempt to win all the rounds.
In the real world, it becomes slightly less clear, because
everyone’s got different goals, different “bars” other than simple
health. Some people want to be loved, some people want to have
adventure, and some people want to have all the power they can
have. Some people just want to be at peace. Some people don’t want
to be here at all, they can’t wait to get off this trip. Everyone in this
world has a completely different set of responses that are kind of
hard to predict, somewhat, unless you become a master manipulator
or an expert at human behavior.
Try to find relevancies in life, so that when a thing is similar to
something else, and you understand the first thing, you now nearly
instantly understand the next thing, and all other things like it that
you ever see again. Take doors, for instance. Every single door that
you meet is very different from the last. Some push open, some pull,
and some are bi-curious. Some are even split in the middle and just
the top can be opened, some are revolving doors. They’re made of
wood, glass, metal, or other materials. They even lock in all kinds of
different ways, from simple to complex. A vault lock may be
extremely complex in operation, but because you understand the
concept of doors, you realize that it’s all relatively the same idea.
(And you can recognize that they look cool in comparison to a
simple wooden bedroom door)
Make cool sayings to ease understanding of ideas & name patterns

You can find the disappearing middle for a logical fallacy. All
these examples we have of parable and easy to understand sayings,
makes understanding complicated stuff a hell of a lot easier, because
if you didn’t have those cool sayings, you might never understand
the idea.
Some things are hard to understand. When you name a pattern,
it’s easier to recognize it and use it in the future.
Anthropomorphizing ideas is effective
Turn a lot of ideas into people, because people are used to dealing
with people.
Thinking
Getting the best out of your brain processing power
I wanted to tell you about this specific subreddit (a discussion
forum to a specific subject on reddit.com) called shower thoughts,
and why they’re important. I ended up giving dissertation on the
effects of groups collaborating and the evolution of their
environments on the Internet.

Shower thoughts - how odd is it, that the most resonant name for
the idea of unique things you think of is shower thoughts? Why is it
that these things occur so often in the shower and so rarely in other
places? My theory is that we have a whole lot of great processing
power in these great brains of ours, and that somewhere along the
line one of our great ancestors someone started running their brain
constantly. Instead of only solving problems that were readily
apparent, they started solving problems that didn’t exist yet. In the
animal world, that is basically what play is, you’re getting the
training and practice that you need, without having to risk your life
to get it. That’s what imagination and deep thought is for human
beings. It’s our version of animal play, it’s what makes us more
effective when the time comes, and often we can even create the
time where our creative thinking will pay off. It’s not just the
outcome from the environment, i.e. we change our environment to
suit us more often that we change ourselves to match our
environment. I know I’m not wiping my ass with leaves :)

Wouldn’t it be a waste to take the massively powerful and
creative machine that is the human mind, and have it only run half
the time instead of all the time? This is how some feel about
meditation. If you have to take your engine apart after every race, or
if you need to clear your mind or recharge your batteries, use your
mind better in the first place. The concept is that forcefully
overcoming the well-evolved desire to be curious and think
constantly, by artificially imposing a blank and empty mind on
oneself, will somehow cause one to be more effective in during up
time.

It’s a similar, but perhaps smaller risk, with all this mind
experimentation crap. Perhaps some cult really has all the answers
you want, should you go try all the cults? How about all the
religions? What about all the mind altering substances? It is rumored
that Francis Crick was on LSD when he discovered DNA. If one had
to bet their life, one would be likely to tell you that the vast majority
of discoveries have been made by people not on LSD. Perhaps LSD
will change your perspective on life, and perhaps you will see a thing
in a way you never would have otherwise. Perhaps it would work out
well for you, or perhaps not. Perhaps you’ll get the same results the
vast majority of all other drug users are getting, a change in feeling
and perception, without a big increase in performance. It’s probably
unlikely that you would happen to run into a cult of really drugged

up, “tripping-face” dudes crushing it in the business world or
crushing it in the stock market etc.
Problem Solving
Use your Intelligence to overcome human problems
Modern human adaption using intelligence
How could we reconcile this tragedy of being ideally suited
for the world that no longer exists? Do you know how we can
best use our intellect to overcome these problems in the same
way as we did to surmount all the other problems the humanity
was facing in the past? For the last hundred thousand years a
life for a human being has been brutal, short and painful. There
was no need for you to leave your neighborhood, learn new
languages and find out why the hell something happened. Your
teeth fell out, and there were all kinds of bad, unexplainable
diseases, now it’s better. There is dentistry, and we can now
explain, treat, and often cure those diseases that were once
fatal.
Don’t solve problems you don’t have
Don’t solve problems you don’t have. Every problem you solve
that you don’t have means there’s another looming problem you
ignored that you do have. Take the limited time that you have and
spend it on what is here and what actually matters. Don’t be a
would-be philosopher that learns how to solve the world’s problems
that aren’t yours.
Solve problems and adjust your frustration
The whole world is spending all their money to learn something.
Why is that you can make money fixing people’s phones, why is
it that they don’t just spend the hours to do it themselves? Their
brains have been programmed to disengage in activity that might be
very valueless compared to some other activity. They get frustrated
very quickly, they get frustrated very easily, because 1,000 years

ago, 10,000 years ago when the Earth’s psychology was evolving
and deciding which a better strategy was, some people got frustrated
more easily, some people got frustrated less easily. Back then, in
those environments, the problems that you had to solve were much
simpler. You would see much more profit by getting frustrated
easier, because an alternative, sideways solution would be much
closer at hand. Your range of problem solving abilities was a lot
wider when the complexity is reduced. Every layer of complexity
that you include decreases your problem solving abilities. If you’re
creating software, you can’t be off by a comma, you can’t be off by a
period, and you can’t be off by a bracket versus a parenthesis.
Solve today’s problems
Solve today’s problems instead of solving the problems of the
future that doesn’t yet exist. What kind of clothes will you wear
when you’re the world’s strongest man? Don’t waste your time; you
are not going to be the world’s strongest man. Don’t be shopping for
giant clothes. What are you going to do with all your riches? Which
island are you going to buy? Don’t waste your time - you are not
buying any islands. Solve today’s problems, today. The funny thing
is that by solving today’s problems more efficiently, you are more
likely to end up with the problem of which island to buy, but by
solving that which island to buy problem now you won’t ever get the
privilege of having the problem. Usually in life, to be effective,
basically all the time, you’ve got to solve the questions that are
today’s problem to earn the right to have tomorrow’s problem.
Worry about today’s problem. Don’t sacrifice today’s effectiveness
for the dream of tomorrow’s effectiveness, because you could be
optimizing for the wrong shit, you could be optimizing for a reality
that will never happen.
Don’t solve what others think are problems, but what you think are
problems

Don’t solve what others think are problems, but what you think
are problems. It may be detrimental to be of the mindset of
profitability and solving problems for money, using other people’s
problems to relief pin points, find profit and have correct action over
incorrect action. The problem with that old style belief is that your
paths in life are restricted to what other people think their problems
are. The problem with what other people think are their problems is
that they use their beliefs and their values to decide what their
problems are and half the time, their beliefs and values are screwed
up. Now, you’re trapped in doing erroneous things in your life,
because you think you’re relieving pain, you think you’re solving
problems. You are, but those people shouldn’t have had that pain and
those problems if they used their brains better in the first place. Most
people that want help with a problem, have actually misidentified
what the actual problem is, and think they have a problem planning,
when instead they have a problem doing.
A much higher, better use of your intellectual abilities,
business talents, talents of any form are to not solve what other
people think are problems, but to solve what you think are problems,
assuming that you’re smarter than they are and have better beliefs.
Don’t live your life blocking people’s ideas or solving the problems of
others
Don’t live your life blocking people’s ideas or solving the
problems of others. Another good way to look at that is, if you ask
people when what they would prefer when the automobile was
invented, they’d prefer a better horse. They don’t want a damn car,
they wanted a better horse. The same happens if you ask the people
that wrote the laws for airplanes, what kind of laws they should
have. They already had laws for boats, and because airplanes were so

new, they included stupid laws that said you had to have lifeboats on
the airplane. It took time for the law to catch up with reality.
If you think about the problems of others, or judge the rightness
or wrongness of their ideas, you are but a mirror of their thoughts.
That causes you to neglect your own ideas and restrict your
creativity, if you are only a reflection of someone or something. Let
them react to you by advertising your own truth instead of negating
their statements and falling into their framing of the world. Don’t
live your life as a blocker of ideas and don’t live your life as a
problem solver of other people’s problems, because you will be
restricted by what problems they think matter and what they’re
aware of..
Solve the problems people are unaware of
You think Steve Jobs invented the iPhone because people were
yearning for something that didn’t have any buttons? No, they would
have probably told you that things without buttons were stupid. How
would you dial it in the dark? How would you dial it if the screen got
wet? And so on. Now, everything that we have that’s the best of
class device has one, two or three buttons and no more. You would
have never gotten to that conclusion and created that invention if you
were focused on solving other people’s problems that they were
aware of. You need to be focused on the problems that they’re
unaware of. That means creative individual production and thought,
not mindless group think focused by the constraints of the idiots of
the world that you’re forced to interact with. Troubleshooting is
hard, you need to acquire experience solving real world problems.
Troubleshooting is hard, you need to acquire experience solving real
world problems
Lots of people don’t know much of shit about problem
solving, or how easy it is to make the wrong call on the

solution to a problem, because they haven’t actually had much
experience solving real world problems. In the real world,
when you encounter a problem, that problem could be caused
by many different things. Even when you go one by one and
try to eliminate the potential causes, you run into fun ones,
where things fail only some of the time, but work other times,
intermittence. Another possibility is that you get two
intermittent problems at the same time, so when you implement
a fix, it works sometimes and not others. Or, the solution to
your original problem causes a new one, or the test you just did
to see if your guess was right, actually was right, but you can’t
tell because you just broke something else during the test.
Now, you actually have two broken things if you revert your
fix.
Intermittent problems
There are three things worse than an intermittent problem when
you’re troubleshooting, because what would solve the problem
doesn’t.
Therefore you think it’s not a solution because the normal failure
state isn’t occurring when you’re trying to implement that solution.
Let’s get a better understanding on troubleshooting the human body
If you want to know how poorly we understand what’s going on
in the human body, guess how they test to see how much pain you’re
in? In a hospital, they literally hang pictures of varying facial
expressions and then they assume that that facial expression equals
your facial expression, asking you to point at which expression
matches your pain.
Therefore, you’re in whatever amount of pain the drawing is in.
That is pretty sad. Or, they could ask you to assign a point value to
how much pain you’re in, say, from 1 to 10. The problem is that one
person’s pain level of 5 may be another person’s pain level of 8.

How is that helpful to the doctor diagnosing your problem? There’s
probably a better way, perhaps using FMRI (Functional magnetic
resonance imaging), but the facial expression poster, or asking you,
“1 to 10?” is much cheaper, and easier, and faster to use than an
FMRI.

Fixing things in the real world can actually be pretty tough, but
starting to troubleshoot all these complicated issues you are learning
about is actually easy, because at least you have a decent list in your
mind that is finite of how many potential causes for the failure there
could really be. What do you do when you don’t even understand the
system well enough to know the complete list of ways that the thing
could be broken? This is where we are at with the human body. We
can barely tell what is going on in there, we have a pitiful
understanding of what really happens inside cells, and for the most
part, we are just a giant organization of lots of cells. Think about
how limited our diagnostic tools are to try and even guess what’s
going on. We can stick a stethoscope on your chest and listen to your
heart for a little bit, we can try to hear the sound your lungs make
when breathing, we can check your pulse rate and your blood
pressure at a single instance in time. This is definitely not rocket
science. Maybe we can extend the amount of time we measure and
the rate we sample, maybe that is a little better. Now, what are all the
things we can’t see in real time? Hormone levels, oxygen levels,
blood composition, how many different kinds of cells are in there,
and so on. There’s really not too much we can tell in a reasonable
time frame at all, and most of it requires drawing blood, which puts
extra load on your body, because you need to replace that blood.
You can only do so much of that. Literally some of our required
diagnostics require us shoving fingers or overly large cameras up
your ass. If having another person’s fingers up your ass isn’t your

kind of party, it’s probably a good indication that our tools for telling
what’s going on in a patient’s body are pretty negative, pardon the
pun.
If you’ve not banged your head against the wall for a couple years
solving hard problems, your suggestions for solutions might be
pretty poor.
Mind maps suck
Tony Buzan and the creating of the concept of the mind map and trying to profit
off it - it was an idea of a guy who built an idea that sucks and doesn’t work and
makes the world a worse place, but somehow gives you the hope that it will work out
and waste a lot of people’s time.
Xx Explain more about mind map

Mind mapping is garbage
Mind mapping is garbage. If it was a good way to organize data, books
would come as fold out mind map posters. Because nature is disorganized
doesn’t mean disorganization is a goal. It’s the opposite of organization. If you
thought spitting out ideas linked to other ideas in a star shaped format was good,
because it was “organic” then why wouldn’t you make it 3 dimensional and
rotatable like the real world? Or perhaps have a floor like the real world? Since
you like nature so much, hell lets have wild animals piss on your mind map, and
let a hurricane blow it apart too. Ever try to find a house in a neighborhood with
streets that are organic and curved instead of lines in a grid? It’s a nightmare.
Straight lines beat “organic” squiggly lines.
XX – yes, explain more about mind map if you’re going to take such a stand
against it here
Decisions
Decision

Knowing lots of things is very different from being able to make good
decisions about things. You could say that knowing how to make good
decisions should be the first thing you learn, and know, for it will greatly
enhance your performance on all other things you will ever learn. Just like
learning to read and speak are great first steps down the path of knowledge, so
should learning to think well be the third step just after speaking and reading.

Analysis paralysis
If you want to chop down a forest, you don’t stare at it trying to figure out how all
the trees are related to each other, and putting them in order. You just walk up to the
first tree that you want to cut down, and start chopping. There’s a luxury here in not
understanding the entire architecture, and just getting to work. When writing a book,
for example it would be harder to predict what the book would look like, than it
would be to just write the book. This is why book, song, and movie titles are often the
last thing one focuses on, the creator has to first create the artifact in its entirety, in
order to produce a great title for it.
Making accurate predictions is really hard. Thus, when a problem is
complicated enough, you can be better off just doing the things you know you need to
try no matter what, and while you’re doing them, your subconscious will be working
on guessing what the future will look like.

Most people don’t have an understanding problem, they have a motivation
problem. They think their understanding and their plans aren’t good enough, so they
don’t do them, not knowing that many of the best things in the world started with
terrible plans, and just changed along the way into something great. In business they
call it pivoting. When your first plan doesn’t work, you attempt to execute a different
plan.
This is similar to the pottery teacher who split her class into two. One half of
the class would be graded on a single piece at the end of the semester and the other
half of the class would just be graded by the pound. It was an experiment showing the
difference between being very productive, and being thoughtful, and then just a burst
of productivity much later on. The quality of the people that produced by the pound
was better than the quality of the people that thought a lot and built a single work.
Building things and evolving them beats thinking and pre-planning too much, and
building at the last minute, if you ever get around to it.
Avoid Fallacies
Russel’s Teapot. Clarity can be achieved in different ways
Russel’s Teapot is proof that even if something is already present in the
logical canon and education, that a great and visual analogy relying on absurdity
can be so useful and widely quoted as to become the primary name and
reference for the example. Clarity and brevity matter greatly in all things of the
mind. It’s basically an easier to understand version of Argument from
ignorance.

Proximity Fallacy, Avoid being mislead
There’s this logical fallacy of a thing near a thing gets influenced by the
thing. Michael Jordan wears Nike’s, therefore he’s associated with Nike’s. He’s
great, therefore Nike’s must be great. That’s because human beings’ brains
don’t dissect that well. One can list for you some other great people associated
with some bullshit things, and just because someone is associated with a thing
doesn’t mean that thing is rubbed off on them. The reason I mention this is
because it’s a tactic of association by proximity, which is something we’re
going to try and do by helping our readers achieve everything that they want in
life and trying to get them to take their own survival into their own hands,
which is not something they would have bought a book on from the get-go.
Descriptive names for fallacies are useful for future avoidance
Lots of fallacies have easy to remember and useful names, for instance, the
disappearing middle, the slippery slope, the straw man, and so on.

It’s really hard to make use of the framing fallacy, because it’s difficult to
know when to apply it. If you know the framing fallacy exists when you use
framing to make two things that are equal seem different, you only know that
the fallacy exists, if you already know that the two things are equal. If you don’t
know the two things are equal, because you’re already having the fallacy
executed upon you, they seem wildly different. You can’t make use of knowing
about the fallacy, because you never know when to trigger your knowledge of
its existence, because you would only know by seeing the quality of two things,
and you can’t judge their quality without already knowing that you are in the
fallacy. Basically, because you’re in the shit, you can’t tell you’re in the shit.
The fallacy of the unqualified percentage. It’s possible that people don’t
understand how negative stats on increased crime are unless you get them to see
it linearly. You say, “Listen, because the crime rate is “X” in some place, 100
or 200 or 10,000 extra people have to suffer because of that.” Then, you show
the linear actual crime rates that occur instead of just showing some percentage
that doesn’t have a face.
XX – this point needs clarification, or just re-wording maybe
Do not let mental illusions mislead you
I’ve not seen this one described before
Dissymmetry of 10bto 100 to 10 invest 1000 percent 90 percent Xx
Clarification

Small discount, large increase equivalence, unqualified percentage
Xx I think the language used should be “increases look larger than
discounts”, because look indicates the misperception.

If a new logical description for this common error of using a percentage can
be found when a flat rate may better serve, “30% discount is always equal to a
50% increase”, well then you could use language that says “small discount
equals large increase”. No one really knows what framing is. It’s a pretty big
mental jump for people to understand the Meta context of the way an argument
is structured.
There are two different fallacies that should be described. One is called the
unqualified percentage. You say that you doubled your sales? So what? What
does that mean qualitatively, you went from one to two? Don’t tell me half the
story, the misleading half. Oh, you know, we ramp up our customers 25% every
month, but how many customers do you have? Two? The other fallacy is that
discounts are always smaller than increases, and so a 33% discount is really a
50% increase in cost. 30% tax is really 50% increase in money that you have to
make in order to cancel that out. So, the two fallacies are unqualified
percentages, and discounts are smaller than increases.
If you want to see a place where they execute the real world discounts are
smaller than increases fallacy of understanding numbers, it’s the buy two, get
one half off. When you do the math, you end up with two at a price of 150%,
which means you paid 75% for each, which means you really got a 25%
discount by buying twice what you needed. If you told anyone that “I’ll give
you a 25% discount if you buy double”, they’d respectfully decline. But, if you
abuse the frame, and use the larger discount, which is 50 instead of 25, they
think that it’s 50. They don’t know that it’s 25 because all you mentioned was
Most people can’t do math very well in their head. Be careful not to let
mental illusions mislead you in this way.
So the example of getting 50% off of buying two, instead of saying you
get 25% off when you buy twice is as effective when making sales. You can
feel the pull when you hear the pitch, and I believe that understanding that
people only know the reference number that you’ve given them - it’s called
anchoring - and understanding that people don’t understand discounts very well
is a useful way to avoid getting ripped off and getting 25% off when you
thought you were getting something around 50%. If you’re in the position of
setting prices, well, you found a new way to get your client’s money.
Any time you’re reading the news or some articles and you see something
going up some 100% or down some percent, you must always ask, “Of what, to
what?, or “From what, to what?” It’s the unqualified percentage. It’s also like
Betteridge’s law regarding headlines, where they say “Something could mean
this,” or “Is this really that?” and the answer to all those questions is usually no.
If the thing was actually that, then that would be the headline, and the only time
you use stupid headlines like that example is when you don’t have something
better to write about.
Understanding small discount, large increase equivalence & unqualified
percentage
Scivive seeks to invent two new terms, one is “small discount, large increase
equivalence” where you get a 33% discount and it really means you would have
paid 50% more had you not got the 33% off. The reason that exists is because
sometimes percentages cause you to know less than you originally knew. In this
instance it’s just 33 dollars, you can either pay it or not pay it. The concept of
the 33 dollars being a portion of something else, or a portion of some other
thing doesn’t really matter in this example. What matters is that it is 33 dollars.
What doesn’t matter so much is what portion that 33 dollars is; whether you
take it off the preceding number, which is quite large, and then it makes the 33
seem quite small, or the latter number which is smaller by exactly 33, and

therefore is a larger percentage of that. You don’t learn that much data by
choosing to take your 33 and divide it by one or the other. The learning is that it
is a common misconception that is going to happen when you take a flat number
and try and make it a percentage for sometimes reasons that don’t make sense.
The second invention is the unqualified percentage. So you doubled your
sales, yay! But from what? So you don’t ever take someone’s percent figure
without the “of what”. Scivive calls the fallacy the unqualified percentage, and
that’s basically because the percentage doesn’t mean anything unless you
qualify it with the “of what”. Just like when you read a questionable headline;
“This matters” - to whom and why do I care? You need to qualify it.

Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, the dual slit theory of wave versus particle light
analysis. Basically people think that when you measure things at the subatomic level, that

you can’t measure them without changing them. Therefore, they think that the universe is
conscious and therefore that conscious universe is measuring what your consciousness is
doing. The conscious universe notices that your consciousness is trying to measure
something, and whereas it normally would just allow two things to exist at the same time
and not decide to be in one place instead of another, as soon as you measure it, a decision
gets made and goes to that single place. It’s a misunderstanding; it first is an
anthropomorphism trying to assign intention and group game theory, as to that thing that
has a consciousness and is an individual actor with its own mode of operation. That shit is
not conscious and it does not care what you do and the reason it changes when you measure
it, is because at that level, all measurement involves tampering with the thing you are
measuring. You cannot measure something without altering it, and if you can’t stop
screwing with it, then you are obviously influencing it. Therefore, it’s not the universe that
is influencing its decision, it is you through doing the measurement, which changes instead
of the magical measurement which doesn’t exist, which remains unchanged.

You can do things well even if you don’t understand how you’re doing them.

they will fall while turning, because they didn’t know that they should lean
away from a turn. This doesn’t happen often because they learn and execute it
subconsciously.

Proximity isn’t really powerful by itself. Just because you’re near something,
doesn’t mean you’re good at it. You can be a racecar driver and it doesn’t mean
you know how to tune your engine. It also doesn’t mean you know how to lay
pavement, and the same thing goes for any one of those other industries. The
world is rather complex, and so in order to actually be good at any single thing
these days, you kind of have to be good at that thing, and being good at things
related to it just won’t cut it. Software developers are all the time beating their

Coursera learning how to learn
Week 1: What is Learning?
Brain Facts:
-^ Cells of the nervous system are called neurons. Information from one neuron flows to
another neuron across a synapse. Human brain has a million billion synapses.

Your brain creates synapses whenever you learn something new. Sleeping helps
“update” your brain cells. Literally.
Why do we procrastinate (scientifically):
Problem:
Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing.
This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the
brain.
Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your
attention to something else more pleasant.
Solution:
The trick is to just start. Researchers discovered that not long after people start
actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared.
Remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.
Consider using the Pomodoro technique.
Learning hard and abstract things:
The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice to create and
strengthen neural connections to bring the abstract ideas to reality for you.
Ex: You should practice a lot with the math vocabulary to understand it and recall
it easier. [∫∞ex dx, k!(n−k)!]
Summary of learning:
There are two modes of thinking:
Focused mode: Concentrating on things that are usually familiar.
Diffused mode: A relaxed mode of thinking “your thoughts are free to wander”.
When you don’t desire doing/learning something, go through it and just start. The
discomfort goes away and, in the long term, this will lead to satisfaction.
When you learn something new, make sure to take time to rest, then come back to it
and recall what you learnt.
This is very important. Don’t cram information in one day. This leads to inefficient
learning. It’s like building a wall without letting it dry.
Revisiting and practicing what you learn is important. Research shows that spaced
repetition (repeating things after few days) is the best way to build and strengthen the
synaptic connections.
Sleep is very important. It clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of
“brain use”. It is best to sleep directly after learning new things.
It was shown that exercising and/or being in a rich social environment helps your
brain produce new neurons. Don’t lock yourself in your room. Stay active and allow
spare time for exercise (including general physical activities) and friends daily.
Week 2: Chunking
Chunks:
Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information
that are easier for the mind to access. Pieces of information, “neuro-scientifically”
speaking, bond together through use and meaning. They can get bigger and more
complex, but at the same time, they are single easy to access items that can fit into the
slot of the working memory. For example, if you understand and practice a math
formula. You no longer will need to focus much to solve it like you did the first time.
That’s because your “formula chunk” got so abstracted into your brain that it can only
take one slot of your working memory to solve it. Turn off distractions. You want to
use all the four slots of your working memory when studying. Learning will be
inefficient if some of those slots are connected to something else.
You have to solve the problem yourself. Just because you see it, or even
understand it, doesn’t mean that you will be able to solve it (Illusion of competence).
It is always easier to look at the material, even if you think it’s easy, then working
through it yourself. It gets easier. When you think that a chapter or a book has too
much information and that there’s no way to go through it all; just focus on whatever
section you’re studying. You’ll find that once you put that first concept in your
mental library, the following one will be easier.
This concept is called Transfer; a chunk you have mastered in one area can
often help you much more easily learn other chunks of information in different areas.
Master the major idea and then start getting deeper. However, make sure not to get
stuck in some details before having a general idea. Practice to help yourself gain
mastery and sense of the big picture context. Try taking a “picture walk” before you
dig through the material, this means, look briefly at the pictures, chapter titles,
formulas used... before diving into details.
Recall mentally without looking at the material. This is proven more effective
than to simply rereading. Reread only after you try to recall and write down what was
in the material. Consider recalling when you are in different places to become
independent of the cues from any given location. This will help you when taking a
test in the class. Test yourself to make sure you are actually learning and not fooling
yourself into false learning. Mistakes are a good thing. They allow you to catch
illusions of competence.

Don’t always trust your initial intuition. Einstellung problem (a German word
for Mindset). An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new better
idea from being found. Sometimes your initial intuition on what you need to be doing
is misleading. You need to unlearn old ideas and approaches as you are learning new
ones.

Mix up the problems (Interleaving) from different chapters. This is helpful to
create connections between your chunks. It can make your learning a bit more
difficult, but it helps you learn more deeply. Interleaving is very important. It is
where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more
independently.
Don’ts:
-^ Highlighting too much and creating maps are often ineffective without recalling.
-^ Repeating something you already learnt or know very well is easy. It can bring
the illusion of competence; that you’ve mastered the full material when you actually
just know the easy stuff. Balance your studies and focus on the more difficult
(deliberate practice). This sets the difference between a good student and a great
student.

A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the textbook
or attending the class. This is a recipe of sinking. It’s like randomly allowing a
thought to pop off in the focus mode without paying attention to where the solution
truly lies.
Week 3: Procrastination and Memory
Procrastination:
-^ The routine, habitual responses your brain falls into when you try to do something
hard or unpleasant. Focusing only on making the present moment feels better.
-^ Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by. It uses
a lot of neural resources and you shouldn’t waste it on fending off procrastination
except when really necessary. You actually don’t need to.
-^ The long-term effect of procrastination can be dangerous. Putting your studies off
leads to studying becoming even more painful. Procrastination is a habit that affects
many areas of your life, if you improve in this area, many positive changes will
unfold.

Procrastination shares features with addiction. At first, it leads you to think that if you
study too early you’ll forget the material. Then, when the class is ahead of you, it
leads you to think that you are inadequate or that the subject is too hard.
You want to avoid cramming which doesn’t build solid neural structures, by putting
the same amount into your learning, and spacing it over a long period by starting
earlier.
First time learning something:
-^ The first time you do something the deluge of information coming at you would make
the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you’ve chunked it, it will be
simpler.
-^ At first, it’s really hard, later it’s easy. It becomes like a habit. Example: Driving for
the first time.

Habits:
-^ Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit.

Habit is an energy saver. You don’t need to focus when performing different habitual
tasks.
-^ Habits can be good or bad, brief or long.
Habits Parts:
The cue: The trigger that launches you into zombie mode (habitual routine).
Recognize what launches you into zombie procrastination mode:
Location. Time. Feelings. Reaction to people or events...
Consider shutting your phone/internet off for brief periods of time to prevent most
cues.
The routine: Routine you do in reaction to the cue.
You only need to use your willpower to change your reaction to the cues.
Actively focus on rewiring your old habits.
You need a plan. You need some willpower.
The reward: Habits exist because they reward us.
Give yourself bigger rewards for bigger achievements. But after you finish them.
Ex: If I study for 4 hours today, I’ll watch a movie, guilt free, at night.
Habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. It helps to add a new
reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings.
Only once your brain starts expecting a reward will the important rewiring takes place
that will allow you to create new habits.
The belief: To change your habits, you need to change your underlying belief.
Ex: You might feel like you’ll never be able to change the habit of studying late. This
is not true. You can actually rewire your brain
Joining a student community helps, either online or in real life.
Trust your system. You have to feel happy and worry-free when you are resting.
Weekly/Daily list:
Researchers showed that writing your daily list the evening before helps you
accomplish them the next day. If you don’t write them down, they will take the
valuable slots of memory.
Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time.
-^ Work on the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one
Pomodoro.
Take notes about what works and what doesn’t.
Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.
Focus on Process:
You should realize that it’s perfectly normal to start a learning session with a
negative feeling even if you like the subject. It’s how you handle those feelings that
matters.
Solution: Focus on the process, not the product. The product is what triggers the
pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead of saying “I will solve this task today”,
put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.
Memory:
Use your visual memory to remember things.
-^ Ex: Link a memorable picture to a formula.
-^ Images help you encapsulate a very hard to remember concept by tapping into visual
areas with enhanced memory abilities.
-^ The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses the easier it will be for
you to recall the concept.
Keep repeating what you want to learn so that the metabolic toxins won’t siphon
away the neural patterns related to that memory. Spaced repetition is the key.
-^ Flashcards help. Consider using Anki.
Handwriting helps you deeply convert what you are trying to learn into neural
memory structures.
Memory Techniques:
Create meaningful groups and abbreviations.
-^ To remember numbers, associate them to memorable events.
-^ Create mnemonic phrases from first letters of the words you want to remember.
Memory Palace Technique: Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house)
and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.
-^ This is not easy. You’ll be very slow at first. But with practice, you’ll get better.
The more you practice your “memory muscle” the easier you’ll remember.
Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential
You should know:
-^ Exercising is by far more effective than any drug to help you learn better. It helps
new neurons survive.

Learning doesn’t always progress linearly and logically. Inevitably your brain will hit
a knowledge-collapse sometimes. This usually means your brain is restructuring its
understanding, building a more solid foundation.
You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you
perceive, not by having someone else explaining it to you.
Metaphors
-^ Metaphors and analogies are very helpful, not only to memorize, but to also
understand different concepts.

It is often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.
Intelligence:
-^ Intelligence does matter. Being smart usually equates to having a large working
memory (more than just four slots).
-^ However, a super working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts
won’t easily find a way into the brain. Such a tightly controlled attention could use an
occasional breath of ADHD. Your attention shifts even if you don’t want it to shift.
-^ Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those
naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.

Brilliant scientist like Ramón y Cajal, the father of neuroscience, or Charles Darwin,
were not exceptionally gifted. The key to their success was perseverance, taking
responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts.
-^ Take pride in the qualities you excel at. Tune people out if they try to demean your
efforts.
Right hemisphere:
Helps us put our work into the big picture perspective and does reality checks.
-^ When you go through a homework or test questions and don’t go back to check your
work, you’re acting like a person who’s refusing to use parts of the brain.
Left hemisphere:
Interprets the world for us but with a tendency for rigidity, dogmatism, and
egocentricity.
-^ May lead to overconfidence. Ex: believing dismissively that your answers are
corrects.
Best practices:
Always step back and recheck to takes advantages of abilities of both-hemispheres
interactions.
-^ Brainstorm and find focused people to analyze your work with.
Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others.
Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.
-^ Studying in a team helps you catch what you missed, or what you can’t see.
-^ Don’t fool yourself. Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a team
can bring those projections down.
Test Checklist:
Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? If you had a study guide, did
you go through it?
-^ Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?
Did you understand all your homework problems’ solutions? If not, did you ask for
explanations?
-^ Did you work with classmates on homework problems? Have they checked your
solutions?
Did you consult your instructor/teacher when you had a problem with something?
-^ Did you sleep well the night before the test?
Test Taking Technique: Hard Start - Jump to easy: (Try this strategy with
homework problems first)
Take a quick look at the test when it’s handed to you to get a sense of what it
involves.
Start with the hardest problem. Pull yourself out if you get stuck for over 2
minutes. Starting with a hard problem loads your focused mode first and then
switches attention away from it. This allows the diffused mode to start its work.
Turn next to an easy problem. Solve what you can, then move back to a hard
one. This allows the different part of your brain to work simultaneously on different
thoughts.
Taking Test Tips:
-^ Being Stressed before a test is normal. The body releases chemicals when it’s under
stress. How you interpret the body reaction to those chemicals makes all the
difference.
-^ Shift your thinking from “I am afraid of this test” to “I am excited to do my best”.
-^ If you are stressed during a test, turn your attention to breathing. Relax, put your hand
on your stomach and slowly draw some deep breaths. This will calm you down.
-^ Relax your brain on the last day before a test. Have a quick final look at the materials.
Feeling guilty the last day is a natural reaction even if you prepared well. So relax.

Good worry motivates you. Bad worry wastes your energy.
-^ Double check your answers. Look away, shift your attention, and then recheck.

BODY
Benchmark Yourself
Airplane pilots have an aircraft checklist, and you should have a body checklist. Pilots don’t
take off in an airplane without knowing their equipment is good, so why do so many people not
know the real state of their body? One needs to have a body checklist.
Do you have sleep apnea?
Do you have stuff in your teeth?
Are you using your bad eye to shoot a gun?
Does your breath smell?
Have you had your hearing checked?
Is your vision weird?
Is one arm longer than the other?
Your body is the most important vehicle you’ll ever own. Shouldn’t it get checked out more
often than your car or bike?
Guess what weight you need to be to be obese? It’s much lower than you think. Check your
body mass index (BMI). Calculate BMI by dividing weight in pounds (lbs) by height in inches
(in) squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703. This gives you a number.
For example, 220 lbs / 4,900 (70 inches squared) x 703 = 31.5 BMI. This is obese.
Here’s the chart:
BMI Weight Status
Below 18.5 Underweight
18.5 – 24.9 Normal or Healthy Weight
25.0 – 29.9 Overweight
30.0 and Above Obese

Sleep
Environment is key. Cut out the blue light. Use Flux software (turns screen into warmer tone
that does not interfere with sleep quality).
Your body has evolved for some activity during the day. Work out hard during the day and
you’ll sleep like a baby at night.
Mindset is important too. Feel good going to sleep early by thinking of tomorrow’s great
performance.
Learn to see the profit in feeling great and being well rested tomorrow. Realize that whatever
you’re doing that you want to stay up late for right now, and screw up tomorrow, it just seems
important because it’s urgent and present now, but it’s probably actually much less important
that what you’ll be doing the next day.
If you’re up when other people are, you can work with them. How many things are happening
late at night are actually time limited? You’ll likely find that the most important things that go on
in the world are actually happening during the day. Anything that requires massive cooperation
or media impact, or results in profit, occurs mostly in the daytime because that’s when most of
the other people are up and kicking ass.
Are you getting enough good sleep really? You might want to try a sound machine for sleep,
e.g. Marpac.

Oxygen
The fuel you use to be you is oxygen. Without oxygen, you stop being you, rather rapidly and
permanently. You’re nearly more a being of oxygen than anything else.
Sleep apnea is a problem. My father existed as a zombie for many years. “There are estimates
that only 20% of sleep apnea in Americans is diagnosed. How many other people out there are
still stumbling along on their fourth or fifth antidepressant when CPAP is what would actually
help?

Things in Threes
Seems like 3 minutes, 3 days, 3 weeks, air, water, food—you need them in the order that
they’re available to consume in a primitive world. If the world were different, we would need
these things in a different order.

Hypoxia
Hypoxia is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate
oxygen supply at the tissue level. The effects of hypoxia at high altitude: you die totally happy,
thinking everything is going just dandy.
Amazingly, high-altitude peoples of Tibet, Ethiopia, and the Andes have been living at
altitudes of 2,500 to 4,000 meters for millennia and are protected from these conditions.
Pressure-related stuff really messes with your brain. You take a diver deep and they’ll feel
just fine while under nitrogen narcosis.
My scariest example was when I saw another diver having trouble getting his buoyancy right
and not responding to my signals to add air to his buoyancy compensator (less air in his BC
under pressure and a compressed wetsuit makes the diver less buoyant). I decided to write down
instructions on my slate and had him read it, and he still wasn’t getting it, and was looking kind
of freaked out, so I called an end to the dive. He got better once we’d ascended and he wasn’t
high, and we got to the surface just fine a few minutes later.
I started explaining his issues and showed him my slate again. I had scribbled complete
gibberish on the slate - like letters on top of each other and random squiggles. I knew he was
having narc issues and what he needed to do to control his dive, but had no idea I’d lost the
ability to write due to my own narcosis. It kind of freaked me out.

Diet
Looking at Weight Loss in Linear Terms
If you’re a giant fat fellow, it seems as though you’re very far from your goal of being fit,
because if you diet a whole day, you are like .01%, or some small percentage, closer to your
goal, right? The fatter you are and the skinnier you need to be, then the smaller the percentage

toward your goal you actually are. If you look at it in percentage terms, you’re far away from
your goal the fatter you are, which is discouraging.
If you look at it instead in linear terms instead of percentage terms, and you just say, how
much weight can I lose in a week? Well then, as a fat guy, you’re actually at an advantage,
because you can lose more weight in a day because your body’s just smoking through calories
much faster. One way, you’re very disenchanted, which is probably the wrong way to view it in
that you’re farthest possible away from your goal because you’re a monster. The other way is
probably a better way to look at it, which is because it’s much easier for you to make linear
progress because you actually use so many calories at rest during the day.
It can be more fun to visualize weight loss or other goals by their distance and not their time,
because you can accelerate how much distance you cover, but you can’t accelerate time. For
instance, if you need to lose 10 lbs., that’s the same as 3 ,500 kilometers on a stationary bike.
We’ve evolved to hoard physical things that are countable, and thus having a distance goal can
feel like collecting something valuable. Having a time goal is a layer or two removed.

Eat to Live, Don’t Live to Eat
Eat to live, don’t live to eat, at least in terms of quantity. You don’t need much quantity to
have quality. When you eat you must see how little you can eat, not how much. You’ve already
tried eating how much you can get away with, and where has that gotten you?

The Power of Calories
The difference between a 6-inch sub and a 12-inch sub is 45 lbs.
If you have three extra sodas a day, you will be roughly 45 lbs. heavier for the rest of your
life. That’s how powerful calories are. Consequently, if you drink three sodas less a day—and we
are talking normal cans of soda, not the monstrosities you can find for sale at your local
convenience store—you will lose weight.
You will find by surveying people that they don’t know how many calories turns into a
pound. Knowing how many calories you are eating is only useful to you if you know how those
calories are going to affect you. That is only possible if you know how many calories a day your
body actually uses.

You also can’t have false beliefs about how many calories exercise is worth. If you exercise
on a bike for 20 minutes and burn 300 calories, you can’t then have a snack to reward yourself.
Almost any popular, pre-made snack you reach for is going to have more than 300 calories in it.
You spend less money on food by eating less as well. You spend less time eating. You spend
less time traveling to eat. That saves you money on gas and the likelihood of an accident. Your
chance to live longer increases. You’ll be healthier and have a better immune system. Fit into
more common and more stylish clothing. You’ll be faster. Need less sleep. That means more
time awake to enjoy all these other benefits. Most important of all, you will look better in a
bathing suit.
Just to overkill on it, you’ll also serve as an example to your loved ones, be able to flee and
chase faster, and are likely to be paid more at your work, fit through tighter spaces, set off the
alarm on the elevator less, pay less for health insurance, need to use the health insurance that you
may already have less, cause the death of fewer animals or plants or likely both. You will also
use ever so slightly less gasoline commuting to work. There’s a whole lot of upside here. You’re
also less of a target if you play dodge ball or paintball.
In a world where we’re much more limited by how much we emotionally want something
than by our intellectual ability to understand how to get it, it’s more important to have a
consuming desire and drive towards something, than it is to optimize how you get to the goal. A
great plan not executed is far worse than an average plan executed well, at least where matters of
life and death and injury are not as large a concern. That’s why the “why” doing of something is
much more important than the “how,” as far as motivation is concerned. For a person who
already has strong enough “why’s” and is already dedicating the hours, for those few, the “how”
is far more important.
How do you make sure that you’re hitting the right caloric intake? First, know how many
calories you actually use in a day. If you only eat foods that have a known caloric value, it will
be much easier to add up how many calories you eat in a day. Some people have good luck with
an app called MyFitnessPal. Using WolframAlpha.com, you can calculate your basal metabolic
rate (BMR). This is the amount of calories you burn a day with no exercise, or if you choose it,
whatever level of exercise you think matches your day.
There are no magic people. These numbers have been proven over and over again. You eat
over your BMR, and you gain weight. You eat under your BMR, and you lose weight. Watching

your calorie count beats and crushes every other form of weight loss trickery. This includes food
mixing and matching, protein vs. carb vs. fat macro ratios, exercise, food timing, alternate
fasting, alkaline diets, stimulants—you name it. It all gets crushed by the basic calorie count.
Which is why there’s a very simple tried-and-true formula that predicts whether you will lose
weight or not, and it doesn’t ask you or want to know whether you are doing any of those other
things at all. If you think the BMR calorie calculator is wrong, please document how your results
differed from what the proven 50-year-old math predicted, so that you and the others like you
can improve the math formula. Like so many other things, though, it’s usually the case of bad
math or bad measurements than it is that science needs to update the formula.

Take Care of Your Teeth........................................................................................................
Think of all the benefits you get from having less caloric intake. Often, people don’t
understand or are blissfully unaware about how crappy some things in life really are. Your teeth,
for example. They don’t really heal. If you break a leg, good chance it’s going to heal. If you
break a tooth, it’s permanent. It’s not going to heal itself.
What does this have to do with food? Just like waves eroding a beach, slowly but surely, and
the chewing of food and other things like ice and gum also erode your teeth away. Since they
never heal, the more you eat, the more you chew, the sooner you will not have teeth left. In the
good ole days when we didn’t have cool tools like tooth brushes, tooth paste, and all of the other
fun things that you can find in the drugstore aisle, your wisdom teeth might have had some use
when they come in to push all the other teeth forward and close the gaps from the teeth you’d be
missing. Maybe you were missing one because you said the wrong thing to tribal leader’s
girlfriend, or maybe you bit into an extra hard animal part for food. Nowadays we take such
good care of our teeth that we don’t really want them shifting around so much up in the front
there, and all of us has met a person or two that appears to have way too many teeth in their
mouth all crooked and crossed over each other.
If you eat less often, you may have better teeth health. Why? Because there’s less chance for
gunk to get applied to them. If you drink your coffee through a straw, it has less time on your
teeth and therefore, your teeth are less likely to get stained. Well, it’s the same thing with eating
right. If you eat less often but larger quantities, there’s less time that the particles get to stay on
your teeth.

Who’s Good at Dieting
You know who’s really good at dieting? Everyone who’s not fat. As a matter of fact, people
who are not fat never got fat enough to have to lose the weight, so they may be the best at dieting
of all.
Fat joke: To make fun of someone that is chubby you could say that when they were
swimming you’d hope that a shark doesn’t bite them so that the shark doesn’t get high
cholesterol.
Dieting beats exercise for weight loss.

Your Digestive System Never Sleeps
The rate which you can gain weight is limited by an unconscious autonomic system that is
always working, whether you mentally will it to do so or not. This is your digestive system.
So on the intake side, you’ve got a constantly working machine that takes whatever you put in
and turns it into nice fat stores for you, so you don’t starve to death. Nice tummy.
Now on the output side, you have basically the same autonomic system of breathing and
staying warm, which if it was balanced well enough with your intake side, you’d probably have
already skipped this chapter, being already fit and all. So now you have to engage your conscious
will power to help generate heat and movement to get rid of the excess energy stored in your fat.
Well, that is definitely not autonomous, so now you have an autonomous system working quite
easily against your will power. The will power is at a distinct disadvantage.

It’s 12 Times Faster to Eat Food Than to Burn It Off
Time to shove a burger in your face, chew and swallow it? Oh, a minute or two.
Time to exercise at full tilt to burn off that cheeseburger? 30 minutes. Full tilt for most people
will really take about 45 minutes. If you’re on the stationary bike at the gym and you’re going 10
miles an hour, then you’re in for 45 minutes before you burn off that cheeseburger. So in
cheeseburgerland, it takes 45 minutes of brisk biking to cancel out three minutes of normal
eating. That’s a 12 to 1 ratio. This is why cutting the calories going in is more effective than
trying to out-exercise a bad diet. And really, if you briskly put as much effort into eating that

burger as you do biking at 10 mph, the ratio would be 45 to 1, because who couldn’t scarf down
a cheeseburger in a minute if they wanted to?
Think of food in cheeseburger units.
A funny favorite unit for dieting, the cheeseburger. Cheeseburgers are about 300 calories
each. To lose a pound of fat, you have to cut out or use about 12 cheeseburgers.
Instead of eating it and trying to burn it off, choose to not eat that tasty thing.
It’s not as easy to not eat 12 cheeseburgers you otherwise wanted to. On a dare you can easily
eat 12 cheeseburgers in an afternoon. Basically, the rate which you can gain weight is 10 times
faster than the rate that you can lose weight.
If you’re using food to change the way you feel, then you’re always going to tend to have
more calories input than you need. Food already tastes amazing as is, without the added benefit
of being used as a mood-altering substance. Those two combined can make weight loss nearly
impossible.
It’s easier to pass over food for a few seconds on a store shelf than it is to avoid eating too
much of it every day if you bring it home.

Calorie Counts Are All Wrong
Calorie counts are all wrong because they include the calories you would have burnt anyway
just sitting there. So you take your BMR and you add your exercise calories, and you think that is
how many you used, but it’s wrong, because a 240 lb. guy burns about 100 calories an hour just
sitting there, breathing. So if you work out for 10 hours, and add that to your day’s burn, you will
be off by 10 hours of 100 calories where you were double-counting the rest calories, once in the
BMR and once in the calorie counter. This gets even worse the more hours a day you work out.
So if you work out 10 hours, your calorie counts are off by 1,000 calories.

Paleo Diet Fantasy................................................................................................................
Bananas are all clones. There used to be another option, but it died off. If you like the idea of
a Paleo diet, you’ll have to just like the idea, because everything that you would have eaten back
then doesn’t exist anymore. We improved it all, flavor and size-wise.

Never Eat to Fullness
You know what, you can make a little change in the way you eat, and just stop eating when
you’re satisfied, instead of full. “Hara hachi bu” is a Japanese term meaning “Eat until you’re
80% full.” It originated in the city of Okinawa, where people use this advice as a way to control
their eating habits.
Drink water, and you’re going to lose a lot of weight. It’s free, it’s awesome, everything’s
better, your teeth are better. Therefore, let’s do the smarter thing, the smarter thing is to drink
water instead of Coke, the smarter thing is to stop eating before you’re full, the smarter thing is
to drink the water before you eat, so you’re already more full. Your stomach’s stupid, it can’t tell
whether there’s water or food in there, it just knows you’re stuffed.

Supplements
Check out examine.com and you’ll see most supplements don’t do much for you. Do you
know how do they decide what the US recommended daily allowance of a vitamin is? They keep
increasing the dose of the vitamin until you’re pissing it out, and then whenever you start pissing
it out, that’s the daily recommended value. Because they assume your body used it and so it’s not
so bad to eat it. That’s the daily allowance.
That seems to be like a silly way to do it. Because things like catalysts exist. There are things
that may not get metabolized. You will piss it out but it’s presence in higher or lower quantities
in your body will cause effect.
When you eat supplements, they’re said to be good for you, but quite often, they’re not,
because there’s something else going on that we don’t know about. For instance, eating fish. We
know eating fish is good, and we know eating processed fish oil isn’t as good. We know eating
calcium in food is good, and calcium pills aren’t as good. There’s either some other things in
there that we haven’t discovered yet, or, it’s a combinations of things that are important. To give
you an idea of how complicated the biological world is, certain compounds have a right and left
turn. They’re the same molecule, just different shapes. And that shape can kill you. Prion disease
is a misshaped protein in your brain. Its geometry causes other proteins to get messed up, just
like it is. Therefore combinations and catalysts play a huge role.

Personal Hygiene
Potty Tips
You can avoid toilet water splash, and have a quieter pooping experience if you drop a piece
of toilet paper in first.
For men, you can pee quietly by peeing on the side of the bowl. You cannot have a split beam
pee all over the bathroom experience if you pre-spread the opening of your expelling point. This
is a bigger problem the more you ejaculate, for it seems that fluid likes to seal the end more than
pee.
People in poorer countries tend to have less hemorrhoids because they squat more often than
they sit to poop. It’s also likely that they consume less food, and therefore use their colon less
often and at lower volumes.
Either way, it seems like the animal world has decided that all peeing will take 30 seconds
regardless of your size, and that squatting is a pretty cool way to poop if you’re a land-based
mammal.

Squatty Potty
Apparently if you change the position of your legs and you squat while you defecate, or
maybe you lean over real far on the toilet, it helps with your process.
Warm up the water while you’re finishing your business, so it’s ready for blasting your nether
regions in the cleanup/paperwork phase. You don’t have a way to rinse your butt? Well, the
Europeans really got this one right. With a bidet, you’ll use much less toilet paper, and have a
much cleaner butt if. Water is your friend.
Some small amount of toilet paper dust and crap dust makes its way into the air when you
wipe, so it’s not vital, but slightly cool, to shield your tooth brush, rinsing glass, floss, tongue
scraper, etc. from the crap dust.

Oral Health
Tongue scrapers are awesome. Most of what causes bad breath is the crap that lives on your
tongue. Some folks unfortunately have extra spaces in the backs of their throats where food
gathers and rots, and creates tonsillitis. Google that word at your own peril. If you have these
things, you really have to get rid of them manually, or have a professional do it, or your breath

will always smell terrible. If you want a more permanent solution, they can laser off the area to
make it so food can’t get stuck in there.
Use Xylitol and fluoride mints, floss/brush/Waterpik as soon as you can after eating.
Chew only as hard as needed, as teeth break on bones in meats.
Never chew ice.
Floss and brush as soon as you can after every time you eat or drink sugary stuff. If you knew
what it costs to fix your teeth, you’d take even better care of them. They don’t regrow or heal.
You have to do everything you can to keep them in good shape. The biggest problem they have
are these little creatures that live on them. They eat part of what you eat, especially sugar. The
problem is that when they crap out what they eat, the acid eats into your teeth. You can starve
them by eating less sugar, and make it harder for them to stick to your teeth with Xylitol gum or
mints. Make sure they don’t have homes to live in. They make houses on your teeth called
biofilm, or calculus or tartar. Get your teeth cleaned by a professional. Don’t leave food on your
teeth for them to eat. You can also shake them up with an ultrasonic tooth brush, reach hard to
reach spots with a Waterpik.
Fix your teeth, smile more, or just be cool with freaking people out with your tombstone teeth.
If you have nicer teeth, you might smile more, and thus be happier. Scientific American
says that by consciously smiling, we trigger a psychological feedback mechanism that causes us
to be happy. When you’re not smiling, it may be because you are unhappy with your teeth. For
example, they may be crooked enough to make you self-conscious. It’s very hard to smile when
doing so makes you self-conscious about your teeth-every single time. By avoiding smiling, you
are dampening your own potential for spontaneous happiness!
Record yourself sleeping. Do you grind your teeth in your sleep? If so, get a mouth guard.

Bad Breath
It’s a giant, giant problem. If a person’s nose works properly, and your breath is rank, they
will be very likely to stay as far away from you as necessary to make the terrible smell stop
assaulting their senses. And sadly, since they know it will likely bother you personally to hear
about your breath smelling, or for some other reason, they see profit in not letting you know
about it. You literally won’t know about it, because it’s something that’s very hard for you to

detect personally. So really you need to every once in a while blow in someone else’s face and
ask them to check for you. Teamwork for the win.

Skin
How do you use this thing called your body?
In the winter if your skin is itchy, you should lotion up religiously. Who knew that? Many
have never learned this beneficial task. You may think there’s something wrong because of itchy
skin, but it’s likely just really dry. Lotion just might fix that. Everyone uses soap, but it’s a rather
new human invention, and as much as we use it, we probably need to cancel out the wiping out
of our natural oils with some lotions.

Butt Hair
In case you’re curious why you have butt hair, it’s a lubricant, and stops chafing. Notice you
get furry on those places where there is rubbing, and if you didn’t have fur there, you may
sustain injury.

Vision
Peripheral Vision
Peripheral vision appears to be much faster in some measurements, and the science also points
towards this. This seems like a pretty great idea from an evolutionary advantage perspective,
because it’s more important for you to become aware of threats and opportunities that aren’t
already on your radar, more so than it is perhaps to deal with what you are already aware of.
Many wonder why they’re mutually exclusive. Does this same pattern of recognition speed
differential exist in other species? Do those species use it for more offense or defense?

Issues of Perception..............................................................................................................
Your left and right eyes may see color ever so differently. One of them may have a slightly
warmer tone with a little shift to red, and the other eye could be slightly cooler with a shift to the

blue. Test it out yourself. Cover one eye, look at a colorful photo or scene. Now put your hand
over the other, go back and forth real fast, do you see a difference in the color tone? If you’re
lucky enough to have the same perception in both eyes, you still definitely don’t see colors the
same as other people! For instance, we’ve discovered that some percentage of us, particularly
women, can see a vastly wider array of colors.
A Stanford researcher states that what spectrum of wavelengths one person is taught to be a
color might differ from someone else’s perception of what wavelengths constitute that color.
That is, a color between red and yellow somewhere might be seen and remembered as red for
some and orange for others. This is interesting, especially, when it comes to memory in the way
that if you and a friend sees a car that you see as something in between of red and orange, he
may see as red. He will have a higher chance of remembering what the color of the car was when
asked later.
This is also relevant to pattern recognition of language both vocal and written: Jesus’s face
imprinted into toast, your grandma’s face, and Jennifer Aniston among other things, and goes
hand in hand with evolutionary theory in the way that recognizing the pattern of a predator in the
bushes is advantageous.
Robert Sapolsky touches upon this subject in his human behavioral biology lectures. Scivive
highly recommends giving the introduction video a try, or reading his book Why Zebras Don’t
Get Ulcers. The book is a guide to stress, stress-related diseases, and coping.
In June 2012, after 20 years of study of women with four cones (non-functional
tetrachromats), neuroscientist Dr. Gabriele Jordan identified a woman (subject cDa29) who was
able to detect a greater variety of colors than trichromatic ones. According to estimates, she can
see an incredible 99 million more colors than the rest of us, and the scientists think she’s one of a
very few number of people with super-vision, which they call “tetrachromats.”
The lens blocks UV light (which would otherwise be visible) so people with artificial lenses
(or no lenses at all) will see the world in different colors. It’s theorized that Monet painted blue
paintings for that reason.

Night Vision
Not every part of your eye works the same. Not even close. Your eyes have two principle
types of light detectors. Cones are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), are capable of

color vision, and are responsible for high spatial acuity. The central fovea (the center of your
vision) is populated exclusively by cones. Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels
(scotopic vision). They do not mediate color vision, and have a low spatial acuity. They are more
common on the periphery.
It’s pitch slate-950 dark out. You’ve got much more color sensing in the center of your eye, and
much more light detection with the rods, which can’t see color, on the edges of your eye. It
changes the way your eye responds to peripheral activity. You can respond to threats coming in
your field of vision quicker. It also means that if it’s dark out, you could sometimes see things
better. By changing the part of your eye that is seeing them, you might end up moving your head
around or moving your eyes around. Seeing something better, even though you’re looking with
the same eyes.

Hearing
The Fletcher-Munson curves are one of many sets of equal-loudness contours for the human
ear, determined experimentally by Harvey Fletcher and Wilden A. Munson in the 1930s.
Even if you account for Fletcher-Munson curves, they probably had wide variance when they
generated it, and you don’t know what has happened from injuries or concerts, or car stereo, or
headphones. The abuse you’ve given your ears effects what you can hear. Unless everyone in the
world is mastering at the same volume in dB, there’s no hope they’re hearing even close to the
same thing.
Some wonder if Fletcher-Munson curves exist for eyes. Would be nice if movies played a
quick test image or two, so you could know if what you were seeing was what they wanted you
to see. This is what they do in the television and broadcast world. The old Indian and other test
patterns.

Exercise and Fitness
Posture
One can often see people bending over to look at their laptop, crimped over like chimps
looking at a banana on the ground. Why is it that the man should serve the laptop instead of

standing strong and having good posture and letting the laptop serve you? Move it, don’t move
yourself.
Runners should have a weight distribution sensor in their shoes to warn them when they’re
doing harm to themselves through imbalance or bad form. You can see some evidence of this
after some time by looking at how the soles of your shoes have worn unevenly.
Scivive likes the fishman idea where you work from a swimming pool, that’s got to ease up
some back pain I’d think.

Strength
It’s funny how much one inch of muscle around a human body gets respect. It’s because that
one inch used to be the difference between winning and losing in conflict.
We wouldn’t give as much thought to one inch more or less on an elephant. That’s because it
wouldn’t make any difference, there’s already so many inches.
It’s also funny how hard it is to put that inch there, or cut fat out. One single little inch. The
amount of work that it takes to put an inch or two of muscle on your bicep or your neck is
hundreds of hours, over months. The amount of respect those couple inches gets you with
reasonable men is also pretty large. It’s funny to think that only millimeters of difference lets you
tell the difference between one human’s face and another. An inch here or there on another
person’s body will cause you to feel fear or lust so easily.
You see, we care so much about those few inches, because for women, it might mean having
enough calories to handle another life growing inside them. It might also mean not getting
demolished physically if you piss off the wrong guy. We care about those inches, but these days
with jujitsu, mace, and firearms, we haven’t evolved the ability to detect and honor those force
multipliers. At least not in the same way we have the obvious physical traits that have been
around tens of thousands of years.
The tools and tactics we have developed over time and spread throughout our populations
makes us vastly more effective in all the things we choose to do, both good and evil. A tool is a
force multiplier. As is the gear, the wheel and so on. You used to get a little out of what you put
in, now you get a lot more. Take for instance, the firearm. You move your finger quarter of inch
over here, and that guy over there dies.

You press your foot one inch down on the accelerator, now you’re going a hundred miles per
hour in your car. You move your foot one inch off the gas, and eventually you’re coming to a
stop.
Being strong is better than being fast.
Running analogy vs. facing your problems and powerlifting. There is a weakness in running
from your problems instead of getting stronger and facing your problems.

Conditioning
Over two thousand years ago, Socrates said, “No man has the right to be an amateur in the
matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and
strength of which his body is capable.”
Whole body movements are more useful in the real world.
Do big compound exercises at high weight and low repetitions. This way you’re getting the
most strength and muscle growth out of the least amount of time. Best bang for buck, if you will.
Some would say you’re getting the most strength, period. Some prefer to be learning or doing
almost anything else than lifting weights for vanity. Such is the competitive life we live. But if
you want a quality mate, you want to be doing some lifting. How else can they tell you’re better
than the rest if the rest look sexier than you?
If you’re going to be sitting watching television, or writing a book, or lazily enjoying the
Internet, you might as well be pedaling your feet while you are doing it. After a while, it’s
natural and you feel like doing it. Best part, you can eat more of what you like, and be more fit,
with limited cost. The downside is that you’re going to sweat a bit, so you’re going to need to
shower a little more than normal. Some people build an exercise bike and gaming computer
station combo. You can buy standup desks, and add-ons that let you attach your laptop to a
bicycle.
If you need to move around for fitness anyway, you could try learning a skill while you’re
doing it. Fighting, dancing, a sport. While the gains you make in fitness can be eaten away by the
passage of time and laziness, the skills gained stay for a lifetime.

The Gym...............................................................................................................................
If you go to a gym rat who’s huge, he might know how to work out well, or he might not.
How big he is has nothing to do with what he knows. It has to do with how long he has been in
the gym, and so the people who get the biggest are not always the smartest.
People who get the most results in the gym are the ones who have done it the longest. You are
as fit as you have been recently working out consistently.
As soon as you stop working out consistently, for a period of time, whatever fitness you had
disappears quickly. This is why I like weight loss better than fitness, because when you lose
weight, that burdening weight stays lost. When you lift weights and get stronger, maybe you get
a little muscle memory, maybe it comes back a little quicker.

Steroids
You have to look at drug sales, assuming they’re not lying about the numbers. Which they
probably aren’t. Companies are required by law to be truthful and all, if they’re a public
company.
Who’s taking all these steroids? Truckloads of them are being sold. Somebody’s taking them.
Well, some would say that the people who are the most gigantic are taking them. They could
assume the same thing for any type of other performance enhancing substances.
Some studies show that taking steroids adds more performance than lifting weights, by a
factor of like maybe fifty percent more, or double. By taking steroids you put on more muscle
mass than you will by actually lifting weights. If that’s the case, then might you save yourself the
time, unless you really need to learn the physical exertive of skills of being able to actually lift
heavy stuff?
You never intend to lift heavy items anyway. You’re doing it just for looks. Might not the
time saving of some steroids outperform actual weight lifting? And then you’ve got the thing that
when you’re in the store and you see some guy who’s obviously jacked on steroids and just
drinking coffee and protein. Do you want to live that lifestyle? Even if you did, how are you
going to get there without the steroids?
Let’s say that guy on water, chicken, and steroids is up against you, on working out. You’re
getting crushed by double. You aren’t going to ever be able to make it up. I don’t see any other
way in today’s environment, since everyone decided to hop on the illegal drug freight train.

Should you not go that route, if that’s your goal? If everyone else decides that they’re going to
work for free and you decide you want to keep charging. I don’t see how you’ll win that battle.

Weight Training
Think about how useful weight training is. There’s still things you can’t train. Let’s say you
want to grab a rusted bolt and unscrew it, your hands won’t be strong enough, no matter what.
You still need a screwdriver. Still need pliers for leverage.
Some fat dudes look stronger than they really are. Work on the muscles people see, and look
strong. Fat distribution on your arms can make you look stronger, or on your legs make you go
slower (or arms.)

The 40% Rule
The 40% Rule is a concept used by Navy SEALs to increase mental toughness. The story was
told by Jesse Itzler in his audiobook, Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest
Man on the Planet.
Itzler wrote about his houseguest, “He would say that when your mind is telling you you’re
done, you’re really only 40 percent done. And he had a motto: If it doesn’t suck we don’t do it.
And that was his way of forcing us to get uncomfortable to figure out what our baseline was and
what our comfort level was and just turning it upside-down.”
One way of thinking about the 40% rule is to “train till failure.” When you reach that point of
exhaustion during a run or pushing weights, when you usually would stop, keep running for one
more minute or complete another rep with your weight training. You’ll be surprised to see how
much further you can push yourself.
But be sure to do this safely. Injuring yourself is counterproductive.
Gets your lungs to understand they need to be larger, because if you never reach their limits,
why would they get bigger? It’s the equivalent of having a freer flowing air system in your car’s
engine, free peak horsepower. Everything after you’ve warmed up seems easier, and it seems to
let you hold a higher heart rate for longer, which means you burn more calories.
Honor the tough workouts. The less you want to do it, the better. What if you can’t hit the
same numbers you’re used to hitting? That’s great, you’re pushing the limit, so just back off the

weight a bit, or a whole lot. Unless you’re injured, you should still try to keep up the habits, even
if you have to go in and pretend to do the lift. Whatever it takes to maintain the habit. The habit
is worth 100 times what the lift is worth. Maintain your good habits!

Workout in the Cold
If you want to be warmer, work harder. It helps you not have the drops in performance where
you don’t notice you’re slacking, the cold reminds you that you are slacking. Be careful, working
out in the cold can have negative impacts if you push too hard.

Music and BPM
If you know how to dance, you know that your moves stop and start at multiples of the beat,
thus if you want to hit a certain speed on a cardio machine, it can help to have music that hits the
same beat naturally that you’re trying to hit. If you want to hit 80 rpm on the bike, 160 bpm
would sync each extension of your leg with a tick of the rhythm. If you enjoy dance, and
exercise, I would have to imagine that the dance instinct would modify your exercise behavior by
going faster for faster songs within reason. You can find pre-made playlists to fit different paces
and beats per minute.

Germs
If you’re a dangerous microbe, you need your host to transmit you to new victims before the
host dies. Once the host dies, the likelihood of transmission goes way down. It goes the same for
the common cold and flu. Those germs need you to shake hands and sneeze near other people
before they can tell you’re sick, so that they can’t avoid you. Thus germs and diseases have a
profit in infecting you and being communicable before they’re detectable, so people can’t avoid
them. Therefore, don’t shake hands with people more than you need to unless you’re ok with the
risk of getting sick. There’s a fine line between having enough germs around to have a healthy
immune system, and getting sick more than needed.

Avoid Infection
Touch your eyes and mouth with a different hand than you touch door handles. Open and
close doors with your forearms or elbows if you can, so you don’t get unnecessary germs on your
hands.
In an area with COVID-19, wear your mask and wash your hands. Wearing a mask costs you
nothing and could save your life.
Everyone’s got something wrong with them. Become your own expert.
When you have something uncommon and weird happen with your body, and you take the
issue to your doctor, that professional is going to end up Googling it just like you would, because
the number of things that can go wrong with you will always be much larger than the number of
things any single doctor had time to study, regardless of dedication. We’re just so complex that
the only hope we have to fix each other is to specialize. Now what are the chances that the first
doctor you visit just happens to be an expert in the field that you need?

Alternative Medicine Isn’t Real Medicine
Do you know what happens to alternative medicine that is shown to work? It just becomes
normal medicine. Just like aspirin, which is based on willow tree bark, and has been known to
relieve pain for a few thousand years.
Things that don’t actually work get to stay “alternative.”
Steve Jobs thought he could cure his cancer with fruit instead of surgery. It didn’t work.
Farrah Fawcett refused surgery and took alternative treatment in Germany even as her anal
cancer spread to her liver and killed her.
Bob Marley refused surgery and died from the spread of melanoma from a toe to his lungs
and brain. His final words to his son Ziggy were, “Money can’t buy life.” No, but prompt,
scientific medical treatment could have.
Sadly, it’s easier to trick someone than it is to convince them they’ve been tricked, so the
number of people that can’t be shaken free of silly, stupid, harmful ideas is just too damn large.
Don’t screw with the complex system that is your body.
What you learn about complex systems is that they’re hard to control. When you try and edit a
complex system with self-regulating behaviors, you can’t just change one thing. You have to
change another thing that helps edit the response to thing that you changed. That cascading

waterfall effect of all the different things you didn’t know you’re supposed to be measuring or
you didn’t notice changed leads to the wrong outcomes that you didn’t want.
A good argument for human beings as the most complicated thing we’re aware of in the world
is by defining complexity as the number of components a thing has. The number of variables.
That is the number of self-modifying things that make understanding much harder. Because what
you understood in the beginning, as soon as you attempt to make a change, it changes itself in
response in a way that almost seems conscious. Like a conscious actor.
You’re at risk from trying to make modifications to that complicated system. It’s probably
larger than you know, and probably larger than you’ll ever actually be able to know, until we
discover a great deal more about how the body works. And it goes the same way for any
complex system. Medicines, in particular, are a good example. If you can avoid taking medicines
that you don’t need, then you also get to avoid discovering how those medicines were actually
misunderstood. Don’t let drug companies discover their drugs’ safety on you. When would you
be willing to take more risks? Well, if you’re trying to avoid the uncertain negative outcome that
you don’t know could happen, but you don’t want to find out either, that’s the one thing you’re
measuring.
Fear of uncertainty. Accurate fear, proper fear. Fear works—that’s why it’s still around. It’s
very effective. Fear is quite good when used properly. If you already know that a separate
terrible thing is coming for you, and is more certain, well then it’s a good trade.

The Mind-Body Connection
In life, your body is a self-correcting, self-regulating, basically conscious actor. I’m stretching
the use of the word “conscious,” but it has its own agenda whether it’s conscious of it or not, and
it wants you to do things a certain way, especially when you decide that you’re going to fight
about an issue. Like, “Hey, body, I want you to have less body fat.” Or, “Hey, body, I want you
to feel high. I want you to feel connected to the world, and have hallucinating trails that you see,
and I want your heart rate to be really fast and like feel feelings of euphoria ecstasy.” When you
want those things from your body, your body doesn’t want those things. Your body will respond
to those chemicals that it doesn’t want there by locking up the receptor they’re trying to bind to
with other things, or by becoming tolerant, not through some type of balancing behavior of its
own, but through just some other mechanism.

Maybe your body doesn’t need to fight against what you’re doing because some other thing
fights against what you’re doing anyway. Take light, for example. If you look at bright light, if
you look out your window it’s bright out there; and then when you look back inside it takes time
for your eyes to readjust to that other level of light. Now is that a side effect of your body trying
to do a specific thing? In this case your body is trying to help you have a better view of the
world, so your body’s doing its best to help you. But it’s the reality that’s holding you back. It’s
the reality of the mechanical biological framework of how your eyes operate.
They just can’t see that much dynamic range of seeing in that brightness without having to
lock your iris closed, and seeing in that darkness without having to open your iris up. The photo
receptors we have aren’t as amazing as they could be. We have to do this other external opening
and closing thing to make up for their weakness.
Even in places where your body’s doing its best to help you get what you want instead of not,
you have to account for the fact that a behavior is going to change over time. The response that
you get is going to change over time, and there should be a minimum effective dose. There
should be diminishing returns. And then there should be an overdoing it. If you’re not aware of
those three data points then it’s going to be very hard for you to have a relationship with any
behavior.
Whether that’s gambling or gaming or singing or doing drugs, you need to know the
minimum, the maximum, and the normal. Are you genetically predisposed to have a
psychological problem? Maybe LSD is not for you. Genetically predisposed with a heart valve to
factor arrhythmia, the irregularity of the way your heart operates, where you take a stimulant and
now your body works super long.

Drugs
If you know that you’re going to have a heart attack because your HDL/LDL profile is so
screwed up, and there’s so much cholesterol in your blood that your arteries are just clogging up
quicker than they should be, well then you go, “Oh, you know, I’m fat; this is probably a good
idea.” Because yeah, maybe it screwed something else up, but that’s a good trade for knowing
that it helps this one thing that you know you’re going to have a problem with soon, right? If you
have mental illness and your option is guaranteed crazy, or this other medicine that might make

you shake and pee yourself but you’re no longer crazy, shaking and peeing yourself is probably a
good deal. Right?
Don’t take an absolutist view in regards to taking medicine that works. Do take an absolutist
view if you take medicine that you need and only what you need, and be reasonable with what
need means.

Don’t Drug and Drive
How many people know when they read a medicine label that says, “Do not operate heavy
machinery while using this,” that heavy machinery actually means a car? Most people don’t
realize that you’re not supposed to operate a car when you take a medicine that says, “don’t
operate heavy machinery.” Now as far as Scivive is concerned, that’s bad user experience
design.

Know Your Family History
Do you have a family history of psychosis? You shouldn’t be experimenting around with
drugs. Do you have a family history of alcohol addiction? You might be predisposed to alcohol
addiction, so maybe you don’t mess around as much with alcohol. Do you have a family
addiction to gambling? Well, let’s either assume that hereditary doesn’t exist, which is obviously
not true because it’s very likely that you look like your parents, or it’s very likely that you have
some similar mannerisms to them. You might like the same foods at the same age that they did.
If you look back at their history, you might find that when they were young, they liked the same
foods that you like. Hereditary exists. Learn what hindered your family or was likely to, and
avoid those pitfalls. It’s very easy to look up what contraindications are. It wouldn’t take more
than two hours to know what you should be looking out for.

Tony’s Drug Chapter............................................................................................................
I still think it’s useful to compare and contrast repetitive / risky / highly rewarding behaviors,
and the repetitive / risky / highly rewarded behaviors associated with taking drugs, because some
drugs can give you a broad perspective of what actually takes place with any repetitive, risky,
pleasurable behavior in life. A shorter, more “in your face” time frame offers the most vivid

perspective as to the risks, upsides, and downsides of engaging with certain activities, behaviors,
lifestyles, people, and emotions, and can provide valuable data that is useful for recognizing
patterns in those arenas.
Pattern recognition is a necessary component of progress, and some drugs offer range
detection as to where certain practices and behaviors might or will lead, not to mention the
potential discoveries associated with inducing abrupt physiological change. One of the upsides to
engaging with drugs can be good practice for mastering relationships and balance with risky
behavior and high reward stimuli. Some may recognize the dangers of gambling after noticing a
similar pattern with a previous experience. The goal is to pre-simulate the extremes in life in
regards to what you input and practice so you that you can find a nice spot somewhere in the
middle with the knowledge of how bad and how good certain things can be. Minimum effective
dose is the aim, and diminishing returns is the undesired outcome. It is incredibly useful to
cultivate the ideal relationship with the things that introduce change so quickly.
Not all drugs are extremely addictive. Some you just enjoy the outcome and not necessarily
the feeling. Drugs come in a lot of different flavors of effects and outcomes, similar to behaviors
that affect your state. Some drugs can cause psychological dependence, some lifestyle choices
(i.e., religion). Some drugs can cause physical dependence, and the same can be true with other
substances and behaviors in your life.
Some drugs have an empowering affect that allows the user to distinguish the difference
between external and internal stimulus, illuminating a path to proactive behavior as opposed to
reactive behavior. A radical change in physiology is the fastest way to change your state, and
rapid state change allows you to identify self-limitations, or fears, or pain points so you can
modify the meaning and belief to reinforce better ones.
In summary, it’s useful to know where certain behaviors might lead you without actually
engaging in a lifetime of them, and drugs are one of the viable tools for this. If it is true there are
substance that can show you what would normally take years of repetition and focus in one
evening, the upside is tremendous; but of course, everything comes at a price. Drugs are not the
safest tools. However, some would argue that the statistics are misrepresenting of the actual
substances’ danger, but rather the lack of knowledge on usage and recklessness from its users
(which applies to every tool wielded by a fool). One might assume that everyone with a driver’s

license is aware of the possible dangers of the act of driving alone, but do not discard the utility
value. It is Scivive’s hope to see a similar attitude with drugs and their potential.

Cancer
That Which Gives Life Can Also Kill You
The data in your DNA, which starts in a single cell, and divides and divides until you are
composed of billions of cells—that data, every once in a while, also lets something else live in
you. Something that isn’t you, and that life kills you, and itself, at the same time. That’s what
cancer usually is.
One of your cells ended up with a bad blueprint from perhaps some bad luck while copying,
or a virus, or some radiation—you name it, there’s all kinds of ways to get a bad blueprint. Now
usually when that blueprint goes wrong, your immune system notices, and gets rid of the whole
cell with the problem, and you never notice it happened. But sometimes your white blood cells
can’t tell that this cell is no longer following the blueprint that is you, and instead has its own
ideas. It wants to copy and grow when it shouldn’t. Now you’re in a fight for your life against
other life, which used to be on your team, but now it’s on its own team, and if it wins, you both
lose. An odd thing life is sometimes.
They call this life in you, that’s no longer following orders, cancer.
Don’t encourage cancer by harming yourself.

Smoking
When fighting cancer, one of the first and easiest things to do is to stop making your cells’
lives harder than they need to be. This way they don’t’ need to be so active, and then you end up
with fewer copy errors, because they didn’t have to copy as often. For instance, when you smoke
cigarettes, you’re literally dumping chemicals that don’t belong into one of your most vital
organs. Smoke, tar, and all kinds of other things that aren’t the oxygen you need to survive.
Your lungs do the best they can to clean up the mess, and try as they might, they still can’t
win the battle over time. You may have seen the lungs of a person who’s died and used to be a
smoker. No matter how far back in the past they might have quit smoking, the scars and visible

signs off their previous bad habit still remain. Not only do you have reduced lung capacity and
less fitness the whole time you’re alive, you also have to pay the price for making all those extra
cells do all that cleaning, because those cells had to do so much extra work they otherwise
wouldn’t have done, now you are much, much more likely to get cancer. How much more likely?
15 - 30 times.

Drinking
Too Much Booze
When drinking, account for your diminished capacity.
Only cross streets when it’s safer than normal. Take less risk. Do less stuff that might result
in injury.
Drinking alcohol is a loan against the future that you must pay back with interest.
When you drink too much, you usually pay for that fun endeavor with hours of hangover the
next day, and depending on how many laws you broke, possibly a number of following days.
The safety position: Use the safety position of being turned on your side when you’re passed
out drunk or knocked out, so that if you throw up you don’t choke and die on your own vomit.

Be Nice to Your Liver
If inhaling junk that’s bad for you —like smoke and tar, asbestos and nanoparticles, and paint
and fiberglass—is bad for your lungs, because they have to go in there and clear all those things
out, if they’re even able to; well then, your liver has a long list of compounds that it now has to
clear out as well. Your liver’s job is basically to keep your blood clear of impurities, and what
your liver thinks are impurities is often times what people wish it didn’t.
For example, when you drink alcohol, and you want to feel a buzz, you have to first drink
enough to overcome your liver’s ability to keep it out of your blood, and drink enough to
overcome the blood-brain barrier, which tries to keep useless stuff that doesn’t belong in your
brain out of your brain. So your liver is doing its job. It’s trying to make sure everything works
great, so you don’t die to some stupid thing you might have eaten. It takes the hit for the rest of

your body and sacrifices some of itself so that every other part of your body can keep kicking
ass. Your liver is a true sacrificial teammate of chemical compounds, the original, ultimate
Scivivalist.
So what do we do? Because we all (to some degree) desire changes of mental state, and we’ve
found a shortcut to state change by getting the drugs from outside and putting them in, instead of
relying on joy and excitement and adventure and fear to generate those drugs internally for
ourselves, as our bodies are great at doing! So the emotional systems and internal drug system
(endocrine system) make better versions of much of the drugs we try to get outside and put in.
Well, there are good reasons for those systems, and the behaviors that cause them to execute
their rewards when they do; and they get screwed over and can’t do their jobs properly anymore.
Why go out into the real world and explore, when you can trick yourself into thinking you are by
taking a pill, or journeying into a book? You don’t have to do things in the real world to get what
you used to have, back when these systems evolved a really, really long time ago.
Many people now decide to take the shortcut, and their organs pay the price. So while we feel
“lucky” enough to still have crummy shortcuts, our livers recognize them as chemical refuse, and
try get rid of them! You might want to get a buzz, and your liver is literally working against that
goal. Stop having an internal battle with your own organs! Go outside and enjoy nature,
adventure, love, sport, success, and excitement, and you may feel the greatest buzz you’ve ever
encountered.

Does gravity give us sagging boobs and longer penises? This is some definite theory crafting.
So they theorize—at least some people have—that human females have grown bigger boobs just
as a signaling strategy. Maybe, or maybe physics and gravity matters. If you have to feed the
kids, and you don’t have to hold them as high on your body, then if you drop them, they don’t
drop from the same height.
Wouldn’t it make sense that if you went from being a non-erect animal to an upstanding
erect animal, to take advantage of some of the things that geometry already had worked out for
due to their proximity to the earth, and not having as much travel distance? Maybe, evolution
would try and naturally elongate some of the body parts to find their way back down to solid

ground. It is interesting enough—the discovery that if you go from a crouched animal to an
upright animal, some of your parts may have worked better down closer to the ground, and so
they might end up returning there over time.

Internal Biological Competition
It wouldn’t be surprising if people’s eyes were actually developing divergent color and
perception properties so they could combine into a more rounded whole. Perhaps this is why we
appear to have handedness, and use left eyebrow for emotion. As there is cooperation in the
world by dividing roles, so may there be in the human body. We know your gut bacteria is
always at battle, anytime there’s life and a limited food supply you’re going to see competition
for it. That’s not to say that your vision is life requiring food, but your ability to see threat and
avoid becoming food yourself is how such a division of labor between left and right could have
evolved far back in evolutionary history.
It is funny how many things are the result of being selected for. Dogs have ears that stick up
and can be aimed so they can not only hear better, but choose the direction they hear most well.
As humans we don’t have the ability to point our ears or separate from our head position; nor can
we hear the same range of sounds that dogs do; nor do we have anywhere near as powerful a
sense of smell, though we do have tons better vision and vocalization. Therefore we’re able to
operate more cunningly in groups, even more cunningly then the famed teamwork of a pack of
wolves
Because heredity exists, and because we can control which dogs get to breed with other
dogs, we’ve been able to create dogs over time to have the traits we choose. We have done the
same with nearly all the vegetables and fruits you eat today, and many of these things literally
didn’t exist in forms you would recognize 1,000 years ago.
It’s not just happening with living things, it’s happening with nonliving ideas as well.
Since the advent of writing, we’ve been able to keep a reliable record of knowledge through
generations of humans being born and dying, over and over. The people come and go, but the
ideas keep on going. There’s some tragic loss of ideas which haven’t been written, or haven’t
been digitized and spread far enough, or were purposefully destroyed by conquering groups and
nation-states. One such event was the ancient library of Alexandria, where countless treasures of
the past were permanently lost. At least now we’re smart enough to have geographic redundancy

and keep the copies on different mediums, so that even if there’s a giant electromagnetic pulse
from nuclear war, or giant solar flares that wipe out much of the electronics we have today, we’ll
still have copies that are optical instead of magnetic or electrical.

# SPIRIT

## Confidence and Growth

### Climbing the Stairs of Desire

The stair climbing strategy of want, get, be satisfied, want different, get, be satisfied over and
over is the most effective that exists. You’re not supposed to be in any one of those three states
too long, you’re supposed to cycle through them. As a living person it’s not normal or desirable
to be totally still, neither in emotion or location. To be human is to experience not just the storms
and calms of Mother Nature, but of our own passions.

### Frequency Illusion

The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon is the phenomenon where something you recently learned
suddenly appears everywhere. Also called Frequency Bias (or Illusion), the Baader-Meinhof
Phenomenon is the seeming appearance of a newly learned (or paid attention to) concept in
unexpected places.

### “De-Signing” Your Life

Get rid of all the reminders and distractions.
Be your own faithful servant.
Stack the odds in your favor.
Find every edge and use every trick to make the path of least resistance the one that brings
long term fulfillment. Make decisions now that your future self will be likely to follow. It’s a
cascade. The better you stack the deck now, the better hand you future self will get to play.

### Overconfidence


For normally powered individuals, overconfidence is way better than under confidence.
Daniel Kahneman’s advice is dangerous. You may have seen an article in New York magazine
regarding his thinking fast and slow. He says that the most likely emotion to cause you make an
incorrect decision is overconfidence. Some think it’s the dumbest advice ever written, because
overconfidence is what allows people to do things outside the social norms, and reap the rewards
of having no competition in a market, or being the first to do something or making a
breakthrough. Your chances of being overconfident or under educated are the least today that
they have ever been because of the advent of 500 people on Facebook telling you what a
dumbass you might be, and how good Google information is. Those 500 people could be a good
test of your idea. If you were ever going to be “overconfident”, this is the time to do it.
Obviously more risk weighs upon your decisions, if you’re a government or otherwise have the
energy of many people at your disposal, and you should be more cautious if your sphere of
influence is large. There may be more at stake than you initially realize.

### Overconfidence Is Hard to Measure

Further in regard to Kahneman’s thing is that he is giving you non-actionable advice. You
can’t tell whether you are overconfident or not, so you can’t take his advice to not be
overconfident. You can be full of doubt and with today’s progress you could do a thing four
times wrong and have enough to do the fifth, right while the other guy is still doubting himself.
Doubting doesn’t produce anything; Overconfidence may produce many incorrect iterations, but
also produces the possibility of getting it right eventually.

### Aging Directors and Storytellers Mellow with Age

Testosterone is a great deal when you’ve got much to gain and little to lose. Yet the longer
you’ve been around, the more the inverse becomes true. You end up with more to lose and less to
gain. The same effective reduction in risk taking that is wise in a weakening body is wise
economically as well. Look at great musicians or great filmmakers. You will notice that as their
testosterone dies down, the type of films they want to make become less aggressive. They
become bigger pussies, instead of rage or conquest-driven, competitive people. Directors and
storytellers mellow with age.


### Pathing

```
Pathing quotes:
Benjamin Franklin said to write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.
“If you wou’d not be forgotten
As soon as you are dead and rotten,
Either write things worth reading,
Or do things worth the writing.”
```
```
“Sell not virtue to purchase wealth, nor Liberty to purchase power.”
Notice that “wou’d” is spelled exactly as that in the source document
Poor Richard, 1738
Poor Richard, 1738. An Almanack For the Year of Christ 1738,
```
### Do What Wasn’t Inevitable

What you should do is your potential impact, multiplied by the number of people it will
impact. There’s another question to ask in relation, which is, would someone else have achieved
that instead of you anyway? Thus there is value in doing the thing that wasn’t going to happen
anyway. Do what wasn _’_ t inevitable.
If you’re writing your thesis, do not do what is interesting! Instead, do what is interesting and
useful, because it’s easy to do. Interest is very easy to pique and therefore what is of interest to
you should also be helpful to the world. The good news is, if it’s helpful to the world, you can
actually make money on it.
Imagine a sick child. The child is dying in the deathbed because of a progressing cancer, and
in trying to save the child your solution is a smart phone app. You pull up Uber, and you hand
over the iPad. Now you keep looking at the child whining in pain, and you ask, “Why aren’t
these things working?” The answer is that they’re not supposed to. Apps don’t cure people.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in order to create some positive benefit to the
world, you need to know how to do the thing and then actually do the thing. Well then, which of


these two is the weaker link? Is the world more lacking in the ability, or knowledge of, how to do
things or is it more lacking in the desire to do things? Scivive will tell you that what the world is
missing is desire. Otherwise, everyone would have a six-pack, be fit, and would spend time with
their families and do all of the things that they know they should do. They don’t have a lack of
knowledge on how, they have a lack of desire and motivation to do so.
If you want to play with the big boys and want to have the biggest impact on the world and
be able to brag that you work on the hardest stuff that exists in the known universe, the human
being is the answer.

### Do One Thing Exceedingly Well

Fear not the man who knows a thousand different techniques, but fear the man who knows
one technique very well.
Well, why would the education system be any different? Shouldn’t you just learn to do one
thing really well and then move on to the next thing?
A much higher, better use of your intellectual abilities, business talents, talents of any form
are to not solve what other people think are problems, but to solve what you think are problems.
This is assuming that you’re smarter than they are and have better beliefs.
People wonder whether sometimes it’s better to go into physics or biology. Well, you’re made
of meat and you could say you’re made of physics, but let’s take a look at that. Our
understanding in application of physics has taken a great deal of money and very well educated
people and executed it over a couple of hundred years. That’s part of particle physics, but before
they knew particles really existed, you can call it maybe 1,000 or 2,000 years with the Greek
discovery of the Theory of Parts, where everything is actually made of smaller things, great!
That was the first instance of this atomization of the world.
Now, let’s take a look at the biological world. How much energy has the biological world put
into figuring it out? Billions of years with the energy of the sun behind it. It literally invented
sex. It invented DNA. It invented mutation. Amazing feats! This is good stuff. Now, they’ve
been at it for billions of years, they’ve had more time to do it. They didn’t require experts to do
it, every species got to participate in the process and they didn’t require a small fortune to do it.
You have to compare, what do you think is going to create more progress in the world?
Learning from the organisms that have had billions of years and the power of the sun where


every component got to participate, or a couple hundred guys with lots of money over the last
couple hundred years? Learning from biology is going to help the world more than trying to
recreate a singularity in a particle accelerator.
In things that aren’t subjective, there isn’t a natural human preprogrammed emotional
response limit to the progress that can be made. How fast can computers get? Well, pretty close
to the speed of light as you move on up. There’s a bunch of computer science theory guys that
will argue with that, but many would agree that it’s a lot easier to build faster computers than it is
to make better tasting food because of the human limiting factor. Might you be able to take
advantage of this? Yes.

### Focus on What Matters

If you have studied for a year in being good at something that is touchy, feely, subjective,
limited, like art, you may never become great in that area. The world may not need you to
become great in that area and the chance that you waste a huge chunk of your life doing
something no one is willing to pay for and not even becoming good at it is much higher than if
you did something that the world is willing to pay for and is easier to excel at and isn’t limited by
subjective experience.
Now, what might those things be? Can you build a house? People like living in houses. We all
like living in houses. Nobody likes getting rained on, snowed on, and struck by lightning. Houses
are great. Now, how smart must you be to build a house? Not too smart. We put a foundation
down, concrete sounds good. We stack some bricks up on the outside to make walls that look
good. Does it need to be pretty on the inside? Sure. Do you like electricity? Sure. You run some
pipe, you run some wire, you cover it with dry wall, you mud the dry wall, you sand and you
paint it. These are things that children could do in playgrounds building sandcastles. You just
have more expensive sand. Literally, that’s what concrete is. It’s expensive sand that’s glued
together.
Scivive would rather see you put your time into something that’s guaranteed to pay off and be
amazing for you and get that base framework in where you’re useful. You’re effective and you
bought your own free time to choose what you’re going to do with the rest of your life. Now, try
and put the artful thing first that’s unlikely to pay off and put you in a world of servitude where


you must always spend all of your time helping other people achieve their dream so that you can
get the money to try and fund yours.
What’s the summary of all this? You need to know the difference between what can be taught
and what can’t be taught, between what is more instinctual and harder to teach. Why? Because in
this free world if you were lucky enough to choose what you what to spend your time on and
what you get good at, you’re going to reap a lot of profit. By getting good at that which you are
pre-inclined to get good at, or is of highest and best use to the world and teachable more so than
you are perhaps becoming an artist, competing against the machines, competing against all of the
past, competing against tools that aren’t improving. Paint and paintbrushes have not improved,
canvas has not improved, what are you going to do? How are technology and the progress of
time helping you achieve your goals? You just chose the hardest path that pays the least, while
being the hardest to teach. How long do you bash your head against that wall before you realize
you should have built a base, been useful, been productive for the world and yourself rather than
messed around however you wanted?
Common habits of focus and common useful questions can help you choose your path. Can I
do this 10 times faster or larger? Who can help me with this? Who already has had this problem?
Are there other people who work in fields close to this problem? How can this help the most
people? Is this the best thing I can be focused on?

### Jack of All Trades, Master of None

The more things you’re good at, the more lost potential you have.
Let’s say that you’re really good at more than one thing. You do one of those things well.
You’re not doing other ones. Thus, the ratio of things that you’re good at, the more things you’re
good at, increases the ratio of things you’re not doing. Let’s assume you can only do one thing at
a time. You’re good at ten things. Now nine things that you’re good at, you’re not doing, because
you’re doing the one thing. Now let’s say that you’re good at a hundred things. Now there’s 99
things are good at you’re not doing. Look at all the unhappiness you can have then.
If you focus being great on a single thing, then when you do that thing, you’re not missing out
on your potential in all the other things you could have been good at.

### Do What You’re Cut Out for, and Measure Your Cut


For example, you want to see whether you have perfect pitch, which is the ability to hear a
note that is played musically and know exactly what that note is with perfect accuracy. It’s
insanely rare and uncommon. If you have that ability, then you could and very likely will have a
much better chance of being able to perform, produce, create or analyze all different types of
music. Just the same way that if you look at the percentage of people over 7’ 6 ” who play
basketball, you will find that some majority of those people play in the NBA. If you’ve got
perfect pitch, definitely focus on music. If you’ve got a fourth cone in your eye, definitely look at
art and things with color. Similarly, if you’re 7’ 6 ”, give basketball a try. These are some of the
few instances where obvious, measurable genetic differences can affect your inclination to be
good at a specific thing. These are things you can test. You can measure yourself. You can go on
audiocheck.net and take the perfect pitch test. It’s nice to be able to benchmark yourself. You
can go on humanbenchmark.com and check your ration, time, ability, memory, and all kinds of
other cool stuff.

### Put Your Effort into the Important Things

The Pareto principle says that 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting
an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs. This means, don’t waste 80% of your effort
to get only 20% of the results. Use it in your personal endeavors so that you address your weak
points. Scivive likes to call it “Pareto efficiency.”

### Wish for More Wishes

Somewhere along the way, adults lose the smarts that kids come up with. They just assume
that whatever you want isn’t really on the table, so they aim for the floor. If you could dream the
biggest dream, and whatever you wanted would become instantly reality, what would you dream
for? Now harness the power of jealousy. Many normal humans with fewer resources than you
currently have, have achieved likely more than what you’re asking for. So they can’t both be
true. What you want can’t be impossible at the same time that others are already living that
reality. Thus which belief is more powerful for you to hold? The one that gives you the chance at
greatness, or the one that has you failing by default, and not learning what the real challenges


are? The virtual challenges are enough to keep your weak ass down. Go out there in the world
and discover what the real challenges are.

### Only Six Human Needs? No!

Tony Robbins’ six human needs—certainty, connection, significance, variety, contribution,
growth—are a bad way to organize human motivations. Nah, that’s stupid—where is greed on
there? Where is fear? This is an inadequate system for organizing life.

### Emotions Have a Reason

Every emotion has a reason for its existence. All these simple belief systems leave out critical
emotions, like greed, or rage, or envy. They just choose a couple, and say those are the ones that
matter, like safety. The map isn’t the territory, and these models of human emotion are rather
over-simplified.

### Caring Is a Resource

You have to choose what you don _’_ t care about. Just as you have to choose what you buy and
don’t buy with your money, you have to choose which things you’ll use your limited caring
currency on.

### Be the Master of Your Emotions

Comedians and musicians make their living causing people to experience good feelings. You
too can make yourself feel good in the same ways. When you’re living in tune with your
expectations, you’ll find a lasting inner glow and smile that just doesn’t seem to go away. When
it first appears, you’ll be curious as to why it is that you’re happy for no reason. This is the
hidden and lasting joy that comes with living up to one’s expectations.

### Adversarial Internal Logic

It’s normal when one side wants to quit the behavior, but on the other side wants to engage in
the behavior. Adversarial internal logic is a breakthrough in machine learning. It’s an effective
system that works in courts as well.


### Crying

Feeling terrible? Try thinking about how terrible you feel, wondering if you hit an all-time
record. It might shift your perspective into the joy of whether you’ve achieved a new status in
life, gone somewhere you’ve never gone before. You might also just feel worse. Some have
practiced by just thinking, how amazing is it that one can feel so bad right now from things only
in one’s head, and instantly the feeling subsided.

### Everything Matters

Temperature affects behavior. Diet affects behavior. Religion affects behavior. Gender affects
behavior. Race affects behavior. Time of day affects behavior. Recent social interactions affect
behavior. Weather affects behavior. People doing the same bad things commonly and a single
judge, being tired of seeing it over and over, deals out harsher penalties to see if it can make a
difference also happens. Everything matters. Yes, literally everything matters. If you find
yourself arguing that something doesn’t matter, you are wrong. Everything matters.
Judges are more lenient in after they’ve had a snack and feel satiated.
If you find yourself arguing that something doesn’t matter, you are wrong. Everything
matters.

### Being a Nerd

You know you’re a nerd when you realize the seasons are changing, and you know this solely
because the ads you see on the internet start including bicycles and outdoor stuff.
Needing to feel significant is the power you give the world over yourself.
Consider the future, don’t fall for the local maximum.

### Socrates’s Death

You’ve optimized for a local maximum of good without regard to the distant future. Had
Socrates remained alive and discovered/shared more, the far future of mankind would have
benefited far more than whatever the local people of his time may have. Thus for the majority of
humans that will ever exist, it was surely not “good.”


## Values and Beliefs

### Choosing Your Destiny

Include quality in your value delta multiplied by market share.
Elon musk has said that the best way to choose what direction you take with a business or a
career is that you estimate how much better what you think you can achieve is over what people
are currently doing, and multiply that by how many people you will affect. So you can do a lot
for a few people or a little for many people. It’s an ok way to look at things, but sadly it relies
entirely on what people will pay for, and as we’ve seen forever, fools and their money are easily
parted, so people will pay dearly for all the wrong things. Qualitatively it’s not the best way to
look at what you should be doing. Who gives a damn what most idiots want? Let’s make
attempts at wanting something better.

### The Fermi Paradox

The Fermi paradox, named after physicist Enrico Fermi, is the apparent contradiction between
the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations and various high estimates for
their probability.
Where are all the aliens? The important question is, whether that terrible event preventing
aliens who’ve had billions of years to dick around and be seen doing it, has already occurred, and
we passed it, or has yet to occur, and we’re screwed. It’s basically a clue that some things are
likely to be coming our way, extinction level events, or at least disassociate with physical space
events. Because we’re bounded by the speed of light, appeals to there being infinite stars aren’t
useful. Those huge numbers of stars are too far away to matter, they might as well be different
universes, or the past.

### Far Away Stuff Doesn’t Matter and We Aren’t First

The reasons we’re not likely to be first to be conscious and alive in the universe, is because
there’s only a single “first” slot and nearly infinite “not first” slots. Thus we’re nearly infinitely


not likely to be first. First or not doesn’t matter, because everyone else is too far away to ever
meet. Damn you, speed of light limit!
Turning inward isn’t as likely as turning outward. Choosing to turn inward instead of
travelling the stars is not likely, for turning inward still has an energy cost, and energy is finite
per unit of space, thus you must choose between starving other life of energy (think tress
competing for height) or you can expand. Expanding has too much profit to be ignored by that
which evolved to meet the question.

### Make a Great Melting Pot, for Real

Let’s just get some diversity in all the other countries too, let’s just open up all the borders,
force every country to reflect the makeup of the world, and watch it all fall apart and split up
again. Worried about no diversity where you live? Great, go destroy all diversity by equally
mixing everyone everywhere.

### Vive la Différence

Ignorance of difference is insulting and demeaning. Get an agreement that calling everyone
the same is bad.
Point to a set that has two parts that would be insulted if you call them the same, perhaps
Jamaican and African, or Chinese and Japanese. Get agreement that calling two different peoples
the same thing is insulting. Replace those parts with male and female gender instead of
nationality. Hope they get the analogy that calling men and women the same is as insulting as it
was to call the other two parts the same.
You could also use skin color or language or age, or height as the blurred lens you’re looking
at people through. Whatever you think the listener will have the easiest time noticing that
ignoring differences is wrong. The result should be the realization of trying to destroy
differences is harmful, and where it should be done, the benefit should outweigh the cost.
It would be insulting to say that everyone from Africa was the same, as it would be to say that
all slate-950 people were the same. As it would be to say men and women are all the same. The
ignorance of difference is insulting. Destroying differences is worse than insulting and thus
perhaps your quota on how many people of a certain type should be in your job or profession is


also insulting. Perhaps their choice as to where they want to exist and what they want to do is
superior to yours. Stop insulting and doing other larger harms to people by assuming you know
better for them what profession or lifestyle they should be leading. You wouldn’t do it with their
music, or with their choice of beverage, so how dare you do it in regards to their work or
education?

### Differences Between Men and Women

If you think men and women are the same, you either don’t know much about men, or
woman, or both.
Women get cancer less than men.
If women have a pay gap—getting lower pay for jobs that should pay the same—then men
have an hours gap, doing more work than women. The inverse could show the stupidity of it;
trading women pay gap for male hours gap.

### Priorities

What are you actually making profit off doing? What’s really worth it? To help you see, what
would you be willing to pay to do everything you do? No more free things, not even your job.
It’s unfair to call things wage gaps, as it makes a presupposition that things are supposed to be
equal, and we have a natural tendency to dislike gaps.

### Maybe You Should Write a Book

If you’re smart enough to educate yourself and have the correct opinion about a subject, then
why let that benefit die in your mind? You might as well help others benefit from the work
you’ve put in.
It’s similar to the idea that if you’re smart enough to buy the right product at a good price,
then you’re also smart enough to advertise and let others benefit from that good decision you
made. They’re two sides of the same coin. If you’re smart enough to know what to buy, from
whom, and why, then you’re smart enough to transmit that same information on to the next
person so he can make the same informed decision. If you need to be well educated on a thing to


have that good thing in your life, then you can if you choose, let others benefit from that
knowledge. As a bonus, sharing that knowledge can even be profitable to you, everyone wins.

### Intelligent Design

Why is your heart not directly in the middle? Why does your stomach work better when you
sleep laying one direction instead of another?

### Inbreeding Might Be a Feature, Not a Bug

Inbreeding is problematic and often illegal. Wouldn’t it have been easier to make having
children with your own children impossible, as it’s impossible for humans to generate offspring
with a horse? Seems like the system for making kids isn’t well optimized. Perhaps it’s a feature,
not a bug though. If you can’t find any other mate at all, maybe inbreeding beats extinction as far
as survival goes.

### Appearing Good While Being Bad

Fudging the crime stats. Make up. Corsets. Lying. These all make you look good, while you
remain bad, if not worse.

### The Failure of Philosophy

If you’ve read any of the great books of history, you already stand in honor of them. If only
the great thinkers of yore had the learnings and tools that we now have. If you insert into their
teachings the things we now know, that they knew not, a new great work would result. What do
we have that they did not? Computation, evolution, game theory, hundreds of years working on
the things they left for us to build on. This great wealth of knowledge not only adds, but subtracts
from some of the silly ideas the greats had. Silly things like Schopenhauer’s believe that life is
pain. What an easy to disprove assumption. One need only visit a sunny park with one’s eyes
open. Contentment or even boredom is a much more common state than pain. For those
uninjured, pain is a much more rare state than most others.
Smashing hundreds of years of discoveries into the great teachings of old destroys the thin
veneers of inaccuracy and leaves polished the enduring stone. Only through the application of


this hard fought knowledge we’ve worked so hard for over hundreds of years can we see the
ancient, lasting knowledge for the gift that it was, free of the clutter of dated ideas.

### The Meaning of the Universe, Our Reality

Don’t cry over spilled milk or milk that will have spoiled by the time you figure out if it
spilled or not.
Only what is local and soon matters most. If the universe is one of many, or a simulation, it
truly matters not. Those problems or opportunities are the purview of those who are able to pass
the hurdle of survival. Biological problems are coming to kill you and all that you love, they
must be solved first.

### Mind and Body Are the Same

Most people think their mind and body are separate, until you remove little parts of the brain
in their body, then you discover that the mind stops existing as you take bites out of the brain.
That being said, you’ll spend more time in your head than anywhere else in the world, so you
mind as well be great at it.

### Benefit the Many, and They Will Benefit You Back

Scivive wants you to feel good about doing things for the many, so they can do things for you.
You will get more out of helping others than you can get out of helping yourself.
This says doing stuff once is weak, and doing stuff for the many is strong, which is a
statement about scaling, which could easily go under power. However, it’s only useful if you
choose to schedule personal development, and really it’s supposed to change your general belief
and value in regards to helping the many over helping the few, of which the single you, is
definitely few. The problem with personal development is that there’s only one you. You can’t
multiply your benefit by a whole bunch of people. The point here is that, in a world where you
can scale, you will always get more by helping others than by helping yourself. If you live in a
house, and you didn’t build it by hand, or speak a language that you didn’t invent, clearly your
life is massively influenced by many people, who you have likely never met. If you can help the


masses, they will help you back, in ways you couldn’t dream. Focus on the many, and know that
you are not the many.

### Nightmares Are Awesome

What better thing could your brain be doing than preprocessing good actions for you to take if
the worst things happen? Would you rather your brain instead prepare for doing all the right
things when everything is going great? When everything is great you probably don’t have to
worry that much.

### You Become What You Focus On

What you focus on early in life will color everything else you do afterward.
Elon Musk read space books, loved space, now he does space. Anthony Robbins had
somebody who came by to feed his family, now he has a feeding people charity. If something
affects you early in life, it is very likely to affect you later on in life. That stuff matters. Bill
Gates has almost wiped out Polio. We don’t have to wait 20 years for that. It could happen in the
next five years, right? Care most about the things that are exponentially powerful now and
happen now, and then we can revisit these other things later.

### Damned if You Do, Damned if You Don’t

Anytime you have a gift and you’re not using it, you feel regret even if you know that gift
isn’t what you should be doing.
You may be a very social person, you love talking to people. You’re exceedingly good at it.
Unfortunately, you may find that you can measure the output and benefit that you’ve had in the
real world from the connections and social interactions you’ve had with people, and deduce that
they weren’t that profitable. The things you can do at scale that affect thousands of people, far
outweigh the one-on-one conversations that you’ve had.
I guess the only people that wouldn’t agree with that measurement are people, that have never
had the privilege of doing things at scale. Whether they be speaking in front of an audience,
having a business, writing a book or having a blog or vlog or whatever, you choose. What’s here


the damned if you do, damned if you don _’_ t, I’m going to come up with a better phrase for it,
because that phrase sucks.
Here’s the problem. Anytime you have a gift and you’re not using it, you feel regret even if
you know that gift isn’t what you should be doing. How do you win that one?

### Game Theory

To punish the bad behavior of those that have wronged you, you will naturally feel like being
angry, or hurt, or retaliatory, all of which instantly harm the quality of your life. Meanwhile, the
person that harmed you gets to act even nicer, in apology, or may be oblivious to the fact that
you’re even transmitting angry looks and words in his or her direction. He may be too far away.
You lose, and he doesn’t, all because earlier he gained from your expense.

### Dream Books/Dream Boards

The best way to understand the value of a dream book, or whatever fancy word for reminding
yourself through environment, of a different pattern of focus than you may otherwise engage in,
is to know if it influences your behavior. If it influences your behavior and you chose the image,
chose the meaning, and you chose accurately, then it’s useful. If it doesn’t influence your
behavior, or even worse, if it influences your behavior in a direction that was counterintuitive to
your selection of the image, or whatever it is that you’re looking at, or influencing yourself
through environment with, then you’re farther away from where you started.
Vision boards and dream boards can be a waste of time, but there’s this specific exclusion to
how one should use them. If you paste up sheet music on your refrigerator and sheet music on
your bedroom wall, it’s a world different than putting up sheet music in front of an instrument
that you actually play. If you cover your house in recipe books, it’s a world different than if you
have a recipe book when you’re actually making some food. Some feel that vision boards, dream
boards, menus and diagrams and all of those things are infinitely more useful when they’re
directing your focus, when you’re working in the space at that very moment. Scivive thinks that
they’re less useful when they’re just posted everywhere and they’re not really causing immediate
influence.


## Emotions

### Introduction

These are the parts of your brain that usually influence you before you influence them. It’s
like a good friend telling you a joke. They’re going to make you laugh, because you respond to
their input.
Spirit is “the non-physical part of a person which is the seat of emotions and character; the
soul” and “the prevailing or typical quality, mood, or attitude of a person, group, or period of
time.”
If you feel loved or connected to the universe, or a part of something larger and more
important, or religious, those underlying feelings affect how you feel and perform, and whom
and what you spend your time with. It’s important stuff.

### Happiness

Ride the victories. Get a peak and hold it without resampling the happiness. Increase happy
time with little amperage.
“Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now
have was once among the things you only hoped for.” — Epicurus, Greek philosopher (341 BC -
270 BC).
Being happy and complacent gets outperformed and selected against. Happiness is overrated.
The happiness is overrated argument works as a counterpoint to the enjoying of life and
emotional mastery. It’s overrated for performance and future happiness, however, it’s an instant
win in the short term.
A lot of people really care about how they feel. And yes, for your internal environment your
average emotional state, your quality of life, the quality of emotions that pop up, and how often
and for what duration and intensity they occur in your life, that is your quality of life. There’s
something else outside your quality of life. There’s the likelihood that the system you create
through behavior enforces those things to be harder or easier to appear. You might be able to
force happiness as a homeless person who’s in constant pain, because you can’t afford good
medical care, you might be able to do that. However, you might find it’s a lot easier to be happy


when you’re not in constant pain and you’re not homeless, because you have slightly more
money, because you learned a skill that you’re good at. It might even be enjoyable for you to do
something that may not directly give you the same happiness, like controlling your focus and
having positive beliefs. It surely works, which is why when you interrogate people in regards to
their happiness level at certain salary ranges, and their answers are up to $70,000 a year you just
keep getting happier the more money that you make. However, at $70,000 the happiness curve
falls off and it goes negative.

### Internal Emotional Environment

Scivive likes the idea of your emotions being your internal environment because just like
your environment in the real world, it is going to trigger you more than you’re going to trigger it.
The environment has a lot more momentum than you do. It’s not always easier for it to be a non-
reactive to you than it is for you to be non-reactive to it.
As far as your emotions go, your internal landscape environment is going to be like the
constant operating pressure that you exist under that can cause a movement in direction that’s
very nice or a direction that’s very slow. It’s like walking through mud, deep mud, or having the
wind at your back. All your beliefs and values, and common meanings that you assign to things
are what is going to filter all of the new reality that you experience as you’re traveling down the
path; and it won’t always be a path. A lot of times it will be up against the making a path of your
own - trail blazing, they call it.
Those filters of beliefs, values and meanings that you assign are going to change the internal
environment with the matchup between the new things that you run into that are either inside or
coming from the outside, but they’re entering your consciousness; either subconscious or
conscious. Once they’ve gone through that filter, they change the wind, they change the weather,
and they change the walking.
Unlike many environments, your internal emotional environment can change in a heartbeat.
Unlike the environment in the real world, in your emotional environment it is you that has the
momentum whereas the environment itself is actually another variable.

### Better Emotions in Your Life


Do you want to have better emotions in your life? Great! Sit up in your chair straight now,
breathe deeply, and just hold that posture for a minute. I want you to think of a time when you
felt really proud about something, really intense feelings of pride. You deserve to feel great right
now. Feeling great right now, think about what would happen if you took the same belief, the
same habit of feeling great and deserving to feel great, and did a little more often in your life. It’s
only a couple of sentences of work, and it could pay a lifetime of benefits if you feel like it’s a
good thing to throw in there. If you read a book and it just tells you to do a little mind trick that
makes you sit up and feel good, and then you actually follow along which most people have to.
Don’t think about a giant pink elephant right now, Scivive commands you, no giant pink
elephant thinking! The human brain can’t understand that, it has to frame it in the positive, and
imagine it.

### Sciviving

There is this wonderful practice called Sciviving; it’s a way to be happier more often and
nearly free. If you are concerned with the quality of life that you have, the quality of life that you
have is to a large degree the quality of emotions that you have in your life. We don’t have that
many words to describe them and we don’t even really feel that many core emotions.
Let’s talk about food for example. Beef, chicken, steak, fish. There aren’t that many core
types of meat. Yes, there’s different kinds of birds. Yes, there’s different types of four-legged
creatures that are larger and smaller that are tasty. The point is, if you’re willing to categorize
emotions reasonably and ask people to write down the emotions they feel in an average day,
you’re not going to get more than 12 answers. If it’s true that it’s only basically 12 types of
feeling you can feel in a day, that’s quite wide a range. Most people’s range is much lower than
that. Then, the quality of life that you have is based on the rules you have for that quality, and
your ability to associated them with descriptive words. If in order for you to be happy you have
to have a six- pack, 10% body fat, make a million dollars a year, have a model girlfriend or
boyfriend, and win a hard contest that is competitive in any arena once a year, you’re screwed. If
every single one of those things is an “and” statement - this and that and that have to be true for
me to be happy, and if all of those things don’t happen, I can’t be happy. Then you’re in trouble
because you set up the rules of the game where you can’t win.


Sometimes, using an “Or” rule is better than an “And” rule. As a result, you’ve got two
options. You can either change your rules through effort, dedication and programming in new
rules, or be super human and just hit those metrics all the time. Good luck with that.
You can also change your sampling frequency. You can change the rate at which you
measure how you’re matching up on those goals. This is Scivive’s invention. If you’re happy
because you’re hearing some great music or something cool is happening, you lock that thought
in and you make no effort to measure anytime soon to see whether you shouldn’t be happy
anymore. You prolong the next sample, the frequency, the rate, the time between this sample and
the next one. As soon as you’ve got a good one, you slow down your sampling. Ride the dream.
Why not ride that high for longer? If the mission of doing the thing is to feel important and you
already feel important, why risk that feeling of success you just had?

### Achieve a High—and Ride It

If the goal is to maintain happiness, then you can greatly increase the chance that you will
remain happy by achieving a high and riding it. If you catch a wave as a surfer, you stay on it
until it’s over. You don’t try to catch another wave while you’re still riding the first awesome
wave that you caught, because you would crash and you would burn. More accurately for surfers,
you would wipe out.

### Short, Measurable Goals

If you don’t want to wipe out emotionally, do a good thing, have reasonable goals - hopefully
goals within a reasonable range of what you can do so you can get a taste of success and find the
easier way to your next goal. You can just set smaller goals and do it more frequently instead of
setting a goal you can never reach, which just causes you pain. Having goals that are too large
and sampled slowly is not smart. Having goals that are small and sampled quickly is smart. You
get faster rewards. That’s why video games are so addictive. You don’t have to wait a year to see
whether you beat the boss or not. You fight the boss, you win right now within five or ten
minutes, maybe an hour or two max.
Maybe you’ve never heard of this system before. You have heard of changing your rules,
your beliefs, your habits, your skills, but you may have never heard of purposefully manipulating


the frequency of which you measure whether you’ve met your goals or not. Measure faster when
life is difficult, so you can swallow some wins quicker. Measure slower when you’ve already
caught an amazing wave, if you’re trying to optimize for your emotional happiness. If you’re not
trying to optimize for that, if you’re trying to optimize for just crushing and being the most
effective person in the world, and you’re the kind of person who can crush and be effective while
sad or otherwise emotionally distracted, you might find more performance by not being extra
happy, through changing the way you measure whether you should be or not. You might be the
kind of person that can torture themselves into progress and success, as some people are.
I would say most people, when they crush their souls and crush their dreams and make
everything impossible to win, would respond rather reasonably with giving up. Many would
rather go do something else—nearly anything else, whether it be drink, smoke, blow one’s ears
out with loud music, or otherwise distract from the frustration. Forget all that pressure. The
funniest part is there isn’t any pressure. You invent it. There is no actual pressure. You’re at one
atmosphere of pressure just like everybody else.
If you want to ride the waves and have a slightly more enjoyable life, ride the highs. Don’t
ride them forever. When the wave is over, it’s over, but don’t jump off of a good wave to jump
back into the horror if you’re trying to actually enjoy life. Take the time to be proud of yourself
as well. Sampling frequency is a totally awesome way to refer to it. Anyone that’s ever had a CD
player has been exposed to that word for a long time. Probably few actually know what it means,
though.

### Mindset to Feeling

If you ever want a nice excuse to get rid of feeling bad or some negative emotion, just think
about how non-productive you are and think if you’re non-productive anyway, might as well be
happy, regardless.

### Paul Ekman - Emotions

Paul Ekman is an American psychologist and professor emeritus at the University of
California, San Francisco. He’s a pioneer in the study of emotions and how they manifest in


facial expressions. He has created an “atlas of emotions” with more than ten thousand facial
expressions, and has gained a reputation as the world’s foremost “human lie detector.”
For more than 40 years, Ekman has supported the view that emotions are discrete,
measurable, and physiologically distinct. His most influential work revolved around the finding
that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate
and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media.
Another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct
facial expressions, such as disgust, they reported subjective and physiological experiences that
matched the distinct facial expressions. Ekman’s research findings led him to classify six
emotions as basic: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.
Robert Plutchik, who was a professor emeritus at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and
adjunct professor at the University of South Florida, agreed with Ekman’s biologically driven
perspective but developed the “wheel of emotions,” suggesting eight primary emotions grouped
on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and
surprise versus anticipation. Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions.
The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the
basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions
could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example,
interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt. Relationships exist between basic
emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.

### Two Dimensions of Emotion

Through the use of multidimensional scaling, psychologists can map out similar emotional
experiences, allowing a visual depiction of the “emotional distance” between experiences. A
further step can be taken by looking at the map’s dimensions of the emotional experiences. The
emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as valence (how negative or
positive the experience feels) and arousal (how energized or enervated the experience feels).
These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map. This two-dimensional map was
theorized to capture one important component of emotion called core affect. Core affect is not
the only component to emotion, but gives the emotion its hedonic and felt energy.


### Psychological Construction

The idea that core effect is but one component of the emotion led to a theory called
“psychological construction.” According to this theory, an emotional episode consists of a set of
components, each of which is an ongoing process and none of which is necessary or sufficient
for the emotion to be instantiated. The set of components is not fixed, either by human
evolutionary history or by social norms and roles. Instead, the emotional episode is assembled at
the moment of its occurrence to suit its specific circumstances. One implication is that all cases
of, for example, fear are not identical but instead bear a family resemblance to one another.

### Emotional Programming

If you built living things from scratch, how would you program them?
Think about a world where people harm themselves, and don’t care to eat or take care of their
kin because of bad emotional programming or adherence to emotional programming. Those
people would all be selected against. The question becomes, if it’s true that everything that’s
here is here because it was chosen and it worked, then in what ways do some of the behaviors
that are not commonly understood to work actually cause effectiveness? For instance, violence,
pair bonding, jealousy, rage, frustration (it’s a search function), boredom, laziness. You can
basically model what the world might look like if you change the existence or strength of any
one of those emotional variables. You take something that’s universally effective, like delayed
gratification, and you wonder how that emotion came into being. For instance like farming, if
you don’t farm at the right time, then you don’t have food when you need it. Then there’s people
that couldn’t work where it wasn’t obviously necessary, and would lose productivity to those
people that could do work when only it was necessary in a more hidden and tacit sense.

### Emotions Are How You Got Here

Emotions are the programming that allowed the unbroken chain of thousands of “lovers” to
become your ancestors. If one single pair of people in that chain didn’t raise their children to the
point where they could find a partner of their own and raise children to do the same, you
wouldn’t exist to read this book of Scivival right now. This is also the reason that you feel so


strongly about the opposite sex. It’s the pull of your ancestors, and the same effective
programming that served them for those many thousands of years.

### Don’t Be the Weakest—and Last—Link

Make babies, or make sure you’re ok with being the last of a hundred-thousand-year chain of
successful parents. Life’s main purpose is to survive and produce more life, and we owe this debt
to the universe in return for allowing us this experience.
If you don’t feel that pull, then you might be executing the variety strategy, which means that
we must be different than our ancestors, for the robust species wins in the long run over the super
specialized species. Being an omnivore is hugely advantageous.
If your programming for variety has led you to not have sex with the opposite gender, then
you might be the end of your chain. Maybe you can cheat by being a sperm donor, or artificial
insemination, but the odds are that you’ll just be the last of your lineage.
It’s a funny way to look at the paths we find ourselves on. Either you’re doing difference from
your ancestors for robustness, or you’re doing the same stuff, because it’s known to work. You
can’t really escape the paradigm. If you look at spiders, they often make exactly the same pattern
of webs that their parents made, even though they’ve never met them. Some creatures are born
with less desire to be novel, or break the model so to speak. We as humans are probably the most
likely to try different things of any living thing we’re aware of. Have you ever seen reports of
men who just can’t stop having sex with the tailpipes of cars, a very strange auto-erotica, so to
speak? How often have you seen other animals trying to have sex with a car? We surely are
pushing the limits of having kids with whatever we can. If there’s ever a fertility treatment for
steel and aluminum, the world might experience a car population explosion.
Thus, your spirit, your feelings, the programming which has served the tens of thousands of
men and women who ate, made love, and made sure your ancestors ate and made love and were
safe until you were old enough to have sex and perpetuate the process. That programming, that
giant long unbroken chain that results in you here reading these words, that is the real decider of
what you will become, what your actual soul is.

### Our Programming


Programming exists without software and hardware! Take a look at any Rube Goldberg
machine or windmill; that’s also programming.
The programming that governs our behaviors: mood and emotion.
The programming that governs our behavior isn’t needs, it’s mood and emotion. Needs are
just a weird combination of certain selected emotions that is not accurate.
We come programmed with some pretty great software. For the well and normally
programmed of us, lying feels really bad, keeping secrets is hard, we want people to like us, we
get bored, we want to travel.

### We Need to Procreate...........................................................................................................

Some may not particularly like when the truth leads to ethical or moral places that they’re not
too happy with. For instance, let’s say you’re on the edge, 50/50, between being gay and being
straight. If you flop towards the straight side, you have kids and your genes go on. If you flop to
the gay side, you get off that gene pool.
There’s a very strong evolutionary advantage to flipping on the side of disliking.
Homosexuality, because at least in some rare cases, it’ll flip you to the side of preferring
women to men, or at least get you to try that behavior a couple more times, which might lead to a
pregnancy.
Should people be able to love whomever they want? Between consenting, unrelated adults,
yes.
Should people get hated on for the choices they make? No.
Should everyone understand why disliking gay stuff has been selected for by reality? Not by
us, not by evil, just by what must happen to create more of us. Since we’re what’s left, the only
stuff that’s worked in the 99.9 percent of permanent extinction. You kind of have to be
sympathetic/empathetic for both sides.
The stupid people that may not have too many tools to help manage who and what they are,
and what they do, they are executing an effective strategy that, if for some reason they were born
on the fence, they might flop to the side of having kids, and you have to honor that intention.
Then you also have gay people, because you can’t program humans perfectly and we have to
have variation for evolution, they’re just doing the best they can, too. They just happen to


sometimes be girls in guys’ bodies, or guys or girls’ bodies or choose a certain aesthetic over
another.
Thus, you’ve got two different systems, both trying to create people, and more effective
people. In this case, they have conflict, and it creates basically an eternal conflict. 50/50 will
always happen. Choosing straight over gay works, disliking gay helps that happen. Disliking gay
gets selected for, in terms of evolution. Yet, having variation leads to excellence and durability,
so they get selected for, and part of variation is liking different stuff. I guess there’s always going
to be conflict in this area. It results in two conflicting behaviors that are both getting selected for.
By the way, if you have more execution of gay stuff in your crew or tribe of humans, that may
appear as a sign of weakness to other tribes of humans, and they may decide to attack you first to
take your resources. Sometimes it’s not just selected for at the individual level.
It is important to note under the evolutionary selection stuff, that robustness and the ability to
adapt vastly outperforms specialization and niche filling over time.

### Perceptual Excellence

Squinting is a natural response to things being unclear, as is head bobbing and head
movement. This is the reason the birds bob their heads around and those things being related to
the emotional programming for perceptual excellence.

### Color Response

Animals are great at lots of stuff we’re not. You wouldn’t want to get into an arm wrestling
match with a similarly sized ape, because its muscles attach at different spots to its bones, and
therefore it will easily destroy your arm, and maybe eat your face to teach you a lesson about
inter-primate respect. Cats can hear up to 60k Hz, we can only hear up to 20k. We can see about
10 million colors with our eyes, while lizards, frogs, birds and bugs can see about 100 million.

### Emotional Fitness: Seek Love but Don’t Chase It

Either get some love in your life, make that constant distraction dissipate, or see it as a
distraction and focus on it later. If it’s a goal, it’s a great goal. If it’s in the way, it’s in the way


big time. Or, maybe you aren’t so passionate or hormonal, and thus less controlled by your baser
impulses.

### Appreciation Is the Only True Wealth

Since gratitude is a key to happiness, it’s good to honor those that we owe so much. Rarely
have you ever heard anyone genuinely exclaim how lucky they felt that the road was paved, or
that they had such a great language available to them that they didn’t even need to invent. Thank
god for the toilet. Best invention ever, yet do you know the inventor’s name?
The answer: The first modern flushable toilet was described in 1596 by Sir John Harington,
an English courtier and the godson of Queen Elizabeth I. Harington’s designed a two-foot-deep
oval bowl waterproofed with pitch, resin, and wax, and fed by water from an upstairs cistern.
More improvements followed. Then in the late 19th century, a London plumbing impresario
named Thomas Crapper manufactured one of the first widely successful lines of flush toilets.
Crapper did not invent the flush toilet, but he did develop the ballcock, an improved tank-filling
mechanism still used in toilets today.
To these men and many others we owe a debt of gratitude.

### True Courage

Scivive would call it courage. It takes courage to jump out into the unknown and say, “You
know what, I’m going to quit my job, going to eat through my life savings and I might only
improve the outcome 5% by finding the right doctor. Or I could only improve the outcome by
5% by learning about one of these guys who has limited availability getting you a time slot
before someone else that didn’t try as hard.”
That willingness to sacrifice the $200,000 you may have made in whatever job you have in
order to get that 5% chance in your life takes courage. It takes creativity to know that it’s an
option, and it takes courage to do whatever no one else has ever shown you what to do. If it were
common that as soon as you get cancer everyone that loves you quits their jobs and only focuses
on your wellness, then it would be a lot easier to do because you’d have a role model for it.
Many people have that role model experience because they don’t have the financial freedom to
do it.


### Have the Courage to Endure Pain to Save Energy for Breakthrough

Enduring pain in order to stash up enough energy to make a breakthrough to then have
overwhelming success is like holding your breath before a dive, it is difficult while you’re doing
it but it’s the only way you can get low enough and get back with enough oxygen. Take whatever
you want at the bottom of your dive up to the top and enjoy it. During the hardship of getting no
rewards or people telling you what you’re doing is stupid is kind of what’s required to make the
breakthrough, to get to the place that they would never have the courage to reach.

## Negative Emotions

### Behavioral Benefits of Boredom

Boredom exists to make us do something new.
Associations exist so that you could not stay at home and lay in bed all day long.
It just stopped working, and people are tired.
A lot of researchers believe that such behaviors evolve because they provide you with great
benefits. They haven’t appeared at the same pace as the world did. For example, now we’ve got
an obesity epidemic because calories are more readily available than ever before.
Ever notice you get bored of things, no matter what the thing is—video games, people, etc—
hell, even violence gets boring. Why is that? It’s a really interesting optimization to prevent
processing loops where you can’t ever get free. Boredom should seriously be looked at in
programming and machine learning the same way that it has paid off for us. Some would guess
that boredom is a simple way to maintain search space width instead of depth. Boredom works
great when there are lots of smaller problems and places to search with good payoff, and when
the payoffs happen early, or not at all. When the things you need to beat require tons and tons of
deliberate effort, then boredom is your enemy.

### Pessimism and Frustration


Frustration emotionally is like a programming function where you have to decide how far
down a path to go before you realize it’s a failure. In the real world, if you actually walk down a
path to see what’s at the end of it, whatever time you spend going down that path, assuming you
aren’t tired or the environment hasn’t changed, is going to take the same amount of time to get
back to where you started. Every minute you walk in a direction is going to take you a minute to
get back. This assumes that you have to reach the same starting point in order to start to have a
new path, which surely isn’t always the case, but is pretty common (in a wooded area where you
need trails). Frustration is an emotion which is basically a halting, it makes you stop what you
are doing, and try something else.
If you change the level, speed or intensity to which a person feels frustration, what you are
actually doing is putting a limit on the depth of their search function. Or, if you don’t want to call
it a search function, you could call it an experiment function whereby which they are attempting
to do something, which didn’t previously exist or they didn’t have the knowledge of, or they
weren’t good at. Then at some point you decide that we’ve got the diminishing returns out of this
thing; we are as good as we are reasonably going to be in this time frame, let’s switch to
something else, how do we affect that change? You could really hate the first thing or you could
really like the next thing. The problem is that the next thing is like this infinite set of all things
possible, whereas the first thing is just one thing. It’s much easier to cause the switch by causing
a distaste for the first thing than it is to try and look into the vastness of everything else, and hope
that it draws you away from the thing that has consumed your consciousness in the last five or
ten minutes.
You will find that the amount of minutes and strength to which human beings feel frustration
is probably due to the level of difficulty in tasks in the years past, when our emotions really
evolved with our desire for fats and sugars, etc. It wouldn’t be surprising if the vast majority of
tasks existed during that formative period. That’s actually a misleading term; we are still being
formed just as much now, if not more. For the purposes of this argument, we’ll just say formative
period. If you looked from an outside perspective at those people having the problems that they
did at that time, you would find that the frustration timing and intensity matched pretty closely
with the difficulty of achieving whatever task might have been at hand, whether it was to plant a
seed, get a monkey to stop stealing your food or keep the other cave guys away from your cave
chick. We may never have the opportunity to look at that, because progress is happening ever so


quickly that based on our own technological innovation, the natural biological kind is going to be
outpaced.

### Jealousy

Everyone is cheating, so don’t be too jealous!
If you’re ever curious why the people of the world are so beautiful, so skinny and so fit, and
so energetic Then guess what? Just like you discover all the athletes of the world are doping and
cheating, everyone else in the world is cheating, too. Look at all of the drugs that are getting
sold. All the diet pills, all the Botox, all of the surgeries, all of the steroids, you name it. Those
multi-billion dollar industries, they have customers, and the customers, they are all those people
that you look at, and wonder, “How did they do that?”

### Evolutionary Psychology

If you believe that physical traits evolved, like monkeys having longer arms, to be better at
maneuvering in trees and reaching branches farther away, how could you not believe that the
monkey’s emotions had to evolve as well to coerce towards even look up at the tree and decide
that was a place where any monkey would want to climb the trunk to get to the limbs anyway?
The motivation and desire to use the physical tools of one’s body is equally important. Imagine
what use those long arms would be if monkeys’ emotions instead evolved to go swimming. They
would be destroyed by crocodiles and sharks. All of our emotions are as, if not more, evolved
than our bodies.

### Greed

Behaviors that aren’t self-fulfilling enough are self-extinguishing. It is the reason that you see
the same social behaviors in humans that you see in animals. If you want to take advantage of
collectivism as an animal, you need to be part of the group, and you need to perform in social
bonding experiences. If you become socially defective you will be kicked out of the group. For
this reason, you see animals mostly working only with other animals they can have synergy with.
If an animal decided that it would do without food or mating, so that some other animal
could, that behavior would self-extinguish itself out of the next generation, because over time,


even small optimizations that are helpful are selected for. Neglecting your own needs to benefit
someone else that is either useless to you, or even worse, wants to harm you, is self-
extinguishing behavior, and is the reason that pacifists are by far the minority in behavior
strategy both among humans and most other creatures. Any creature that has a territory by
definition will fight to keep it. Any creature that values pair bonding will by definition fight to
keep its partner from getting bonded with by others. Any behavior that allows you to lose, but
doesn’t have an equal or greater side benefit somewhere else to you, will be selected against and
disappear over time.

### Rain Is Good

Any time that you want to feel better about the rain, just remember the trees and flowers need
to drink.

### Frustration Vs. Anger

Frustration is a halt command. Anger is a follow command.
Frustration makes you stop interacting with whatever you’re doing. It’s the opposite of anger.
Anger laser focuses you in on a single thing and gives you tunnel vision. If you see people
maniacally laughing with a master plan and you wonder what it is that drives them and how
they’re able to achieve so much more than anyone else, it’s through rage. An all-consuming
anger, and rage for vengeance.

## Spirit Mind

### What Is Good or Bad?

Happiness is not the best target. Let’s be serious, if you only want happiness out of this life,
you’re not asking for much.
Some argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because
consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the “Three Mile
Island effect.” Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to
the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a


good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned
lessons that prevented future serious incidents that could have been even more disastrous.
The question is poorly formed, as there is no such thing as good or bad, unless you include
when and for whom. As most things that are good or bad are sometimes one way in the short
term, and another in the long term, and always different based on the party to whom they’re
occurring. To leave out those obvious variables is negligent. They’re obvious, unavoidable and
super important, nearly impossible to not measure things. Wrong for whom? With what
objective? At what time? It isn’t perfect, but it’s a lot better. Why are all these utilitarians trying
to optimize for people they don’t care about? There’s no universal good in resource allocation
with infinite human desire and limited real resources.
When bad things happen, they might be good in the long run, so do you focus on the short
term and feel bad, or on the long term and feel good? Or do you hurt yourself the most and focus
on the loss now? Then in the future, when the payoff has kicked in, just refocus back to the past.
You can still feel the negative impacts.
With more complex systems, you have to be creative and wise to guess what the future will
look like. As a matter of fact, it’s so hard that we will pay you thousands of millions of dollars.
That is, if you can accurately predict the future values of things. Go take out a call or put option
on margin in any market, at perhaps forty to one leverage. Now if you’re right, you make forty
times your money. If you’re wrong though, you lose the same amount.

### Certainty Is Rare

Since certainty is expensive to find, even where it can be found at all, you might take the easy
payoff of having a positive outlook. The more comfortable you are with uncertainty, the more
joy you will have in your life. When you aren’t comfortable with uncertainty, your body and
your mind will put you in an unattractive state of stress. You will tunnel vision on that which you
fear, and it will destroy your quality of life. Focus on what you want. Let your life be filled with
adventure you travel through appreciatively. Reject the commonly taken path of stress and
worry. If stress and worry paid better dividends, they could be considered. They take you farther
from where you want to be, and lock you in a state of inaction. The coward dies a thousand
deaths.


### Happiness Is Often Overrated

Why are all these philosophers trying to optimize happiness? If we were meant to be happy
more often, we simply would be. Being more happy leads to less effectiveness in the ways that
we’re used to doing it. The tortured soul must create to relieve pain. The man or woman raised
without love must lash out at the world in revenge or find a way to get the love that was so
deprived. Much of the greatness that we have in this world is the result of need, not want. Happy
people have not need. Happy people’s cups are overflowing. It is that removal of need to destroy
the common man’s need to pursue happiness.
If you are already happy, why bust your ass in pursuit? Save the calories. A happy person
probably executes morality on others less often, and allows the void to creep into the world, that
individual doesn’t want to lose a happy buzz by having to hack at evil with a hatchet. Better to
assume that evil person over there doing evil things is really just like you inside, and they’ll see a
better way, somehow, hopefully. Hope into one hand, shit into the other, and see which fills
faster.
Happy and effective can be done, however, as long as effective is a competition among men,
and as long as happy removes the need to compete. Pre-happy people will be outperformed by
post-happy people, for they MUST perform, whereas the pre-happy, might, or might not, he can
only lose by playing, for he’s already emotionally won. The unhappy person has nothing to lose
in the hunt, only gain, for he’s already in the hole, and sees light at the end of the tunnel.
Now these kind of analogies aren’t the kind Scivive likes to make, for as many colors as there
are in the rainbow, there’s many, many more ways to be human, and feel about things and
operate. However, one can be pretty certain that if you looked at those humans who gave the
most to the world they left before death, you’ll find they were described as happier than anything
else much more rarely than other emotions such as driven, or focused, etc. Thus, one can feel
quite comfortable putting the fate of mankind in the hands of those who must win, and not those
for whom winning is only an option. One day happy effective might be common, that would be
great. As it stands, happily effective is an end put after effective. If you really want happiness
first, just keep lowering your standards and your salvation can be found in a day.

### Use Your Happiness Wisely


Be reasonable with your happiness, it’s a tool, like all the other tools you’ve been born with.
Emotions work, and they work well, for what they’ve evolved to do. When you start altering
them, without honoring their original intentions and reasons for being, you’re likely to find out
the other people with the old programming are going to outcast you, punish you, and take
advantage of your pretty new system of happiness no matter what. During a childhood quarrel, if
you were struck in the face, and turned the other cheek and smiled, your ass could be beat until
they could figure out what exactly was wrong with you, for what could be more interesting than
a person you could pummel, and they actually enjoy it? Well, now you’re getting your ass kicked
constantly, and to the casual observer, you’ve found a way to love it so that’s great. Now some
other poor kid doesn’t have to get bullied when he or she wouldn’t have enjoyed it; you’re here
to be the new whipping boy of the neighborhood.
You could honor the world in the way that it’s been most responsive to, and do tit-for-tat
strategy where you give as well as you receive, or perhaps better. The world becomes a better
place. Tit-for-tat is the most effective thing we’ve found, and it’s literally how we hand out and
authorize use of force by the government. If you commit a harsher wrong, you receive a harsher
punishment, that’s tit for tat. Perhaps your fighting back is getting someone in the state to
retaliate for you through the use of law, that’s fine too. The point is, when you try to cheat the
nice social system that we live in, by taking more happiness than is reasonable, you will be
punished for it. Your fellow man will make sure that you don’t get the happiness he’s felt
deprived of so easily if he can find a reasonable way to make that happen. There’s a reason
vandalism and mischief is so common among men, and it’s because it’s effective. If you break
everyone else’s stuff, the things you have are more valuable. Every experimental non tit for tat
way of interacting with others has been shown to get abused by others that notice that they can
get free profit out of the deal.
Now, if you just kept that happiness inside, and didn’t leak it out of your face harming all the
jealous fools who gazed upon you, you could keep much of the upside of an inner peace and joy
without getting the beat downs, you could even advertise tit for tat, but in reality not follow
through, similar to how many animals mimic venomous animals, when they actually aren’t
themselves. They get the benefits the venomous creatures do, without the effort it takes to
actually produce toxins. It has worked for animals for millions of years, and it might work for
you too.


### Make Uncertainty Work for You

Hell, that’s how the speeding tickets work, right? The sign says that if you go over the limit,
you’ll probably get a ticket, but you know you most of the time really won’t, and thus the
highway itself is a mimicking poisonous animal; sometimes you will get bit, sometimes you
won’t, is it worth the risk? Many tend to follow the speed limit, because to know the difference
between the day you will get caught for speeding and the day that you won’t is too hard to tell
and too expensive to risk, just like toying with the snake if you can’t tell whether it’s a real
venomous coral snake or a harmless “red milk snake” that looks similar.
Sun Tzu said that all war is deception, and The Art of War has been a best seller for 2, 500
years. Kind of makes deception in animals even more interesting. Think of all the instances we
use in our own armed services the same tactics that animals have been using for millions of
years. If you are weak, attempt to look strong, if you are strong, attempt to look weak (angler
fish). If you are near, try to seem far. If you are far, try to seem near. This is what camouflage
does—it lets you grab your prey from an angle they’re vulnerable from, like an octopus grabbing
a crab from behind.
Remember here, some of these things only work during times of war. During times of peace
you’re always better off looking stronger instead of weaker. Looking weaker invites war. A good
tool used at the wrong time is the wrong tool. Learn from the animals, learn from Sun Tzu.

### Enjoy Not Being Happy

You’re supposed to cycle into and out of happiness, just like sleep, just like eating, just like
breathing, in and out. The sooner you worry a little bit less about how happy you are, the sooner
you get a little free happiness. Maybe it’s ok to be grumpy, maybe you like being grumpy. It
could be a good deal for you, or you could be doing grumpy wrong, personality is an art.

### Don’t Optimize for Happiness

I haven’t produced anything for the world in 12 years since I left the company that I ran, with
150 employees. I beat myself up about it rather regularly because I’m not doing what I should
do. I’m not doing what I should do and that I should be benefiting the world. I’m talking about
the very specific: I need to organize my book. I need to write one chapter and then the next


chapter. All the things I know I need to do that are very specific and that’s just book related stuff.
I’ve got similar things with different business ideas. I’ve got similar things with my personal
health. I am a bundle of disappointment when I measure what I am doing compared to what I
could be doing.
We all have a way to do something we know we shouldn’t be doing. For some people it’s
drinking. Then you come back and you’re in a state of stagnation. There’s a time for partying,
and there’s a time for doing the things that you enjoy. Scivivors will tell you that those times are
only after you have got something working for you while you’re sleeping, it’s just too powerful.
It’s too powerful to skip.
Theoretically, you could be happy and productive. True Scivivors could strategize a way to
do that. All it would require is a little bit of social reward, and you could be good to go, but
without that social award, you may find yourself living in a vacuum beating yourself up all the
time. The more opportunity you have in the future, the more pain you’ll endure, because you will
make more mistakes because you are pushing harder. This analogy has been made before: if
you’re a car and you’re not moving, you’re not going to see any bugs in your window, but if
you’re going a million miles an hour, flying through life, you’re going to have a windshield full
of squished bugs. You need to choose. You want to be a shooting star or do you want to be a
dormant stone?
Some people want to optimize for happiness. Optimizing for happiness, at least short-term
happiness, could breed laziness and prevent longer term happiness. If you asked Tony Robbins if
he’s happy, he’s the best personal development life coach on the planet, a very wealthy and
successful person, he may answer, “absolutely.” If you’re in the business of search engine
optimization and you don’t rank number one for search engine optimization, that’s a problem. If
you’re in the business of self-help and you aren’t the most helped by your own self, you’re a
false prophet. It’s self-referential, it’s Meta, and it is recursive. If you’re lucky enough to find
happiness before, or during, productivity, fabulous. But you shouldn’t be optimizing for happy,
it’s too short-sighted.

## Consciousness

### Consciousness Is a Human Construct


Consciousness is like color; it’s a human construct, and it’s a human way of understanding
things, so it’s profitable. It turns out that in the real world, color doesn’t exist, in the real world
there’s no blue, there’s no red, there’s no green, you only think there’s blue, red, and green
because your brain decided it was a useful way to organize the perception of different
wavelengths of light. Different wavelengths of light do exist, and different materials refract the
light from the sun and other sources into our photoreceptors in our eyes, in varying degrees
depending on the wavelength of the light, and that’s all great. But that’s just a human construct,
right? The same way your brain is deleting you seeing your blinking, you don’t notice every time
you blink the same way that you don’t notice you can always actually see your nose, is the same
way that you think that there’s this consciousness thing and it’s important. But in reality, it’s just
a phenomenon of belief that’s profitable and useful. However, just like color, it doesn’t really
exist. Consciousness doesn’t actually exist, you just think it does, the same way that color
doesn’t actually exist, and you just think it does. Can you still make great discoveries and useful
things in life by thinking colors exist? Certainly, sure you can. It’s very useful, but when it stops
becoming useful, feel free to stop using it.

### The Consciousness Economy

Sales and marketing people have power over your consciousness.
If it’s true that the most rare and valuable thing in the world is human consciousness, and
sales people affect human consciousness, then sales people are pretty powerful. Furthermore,
sales people and comedians are constantly refining their craft, mastering better timing and better
wording to maximize the amount of response that they get and their target audience.
Advertising for people to do the wrong thing
If you’re advertising for people to do the wrong thing, you’re killing the mother earth that
birthed you. You’re killing the system you live in. You’re making the world that you live in a
worse place. To some degree that bad karma will come back to you, but sadly, probably nowhere
near as close to the profit you make on causing it. That’s the tragedy of the commons. If
somebody gets to externalize the cost of destroying the environment and make extra profit, that’s
a great idea for them.

### Self-Consciousness


Self-consciousness just means that instead of operating at your meta level, you can now see
above you that there’s another meta level with people walking around on it, and a glass floor,
and you can then hop up there and then back down into the minds of other players, you could call
that empathy. The issue is that the whole empathy thing is more important for team effectiveness
than it is important for calling to some sense of fairness, team beats fair. Fair is kind of the weak
flour that makes the team cake. Flour can be ok, but given the choice, you take the cake.
Thus, stop being ignorant in regards to other animals having emotions; they do, and even if
they didn’t, you would get the profit from the rest of the people in your society of them not
thinking you were a psycho and might kill them, by treating those non “next level” seeing things
as things to be treated nice. It’s less important the concept of fairness, and more important the
team effect.

### Consciousness Isn’t Really a Thing

Consciousness—you think it exists, but it doesn’t actually exist. It’s useful to think it does
though.
It’s like fuchsia.
Fuchsia is not a combination of pink and blue. It is the color your brain comes up with when
it sees contradictory color signals (such as very high and very low wavelengths without the
appropriate middle stimulation). It’s the only color not in the rainbow. Pink and blue create a
lavender color. Whereas fuchsia is what happens when you combine colors in an unusual way
To be yet more pedantic, it’s the only fully-saturated color that’s not present in the rainbow.
Colors are perceptual phenomena; the interpretation of a spectrum of light impinging on a
patch of retina that almost invariably contains more than one frequency at a time. Colors include
white, slate-950, gray, pink, tan, beige, baby blue, none of which are in the rainbow.

## Awareness

### Understanding the Present


It’s funny, why try to understand the ancient world when you don’t understand the present?
Would you rather beat up the guy beating you, or some other person in the past, while your ass is
getting kicked in the now?

### Mindfulness

In your life, you don’t remember everything; you really only remember moments. Your
memory is like any other muscle—it gets better with use. The more you journal the truly
beautiful things that have happened in your life, the quicker you will be able to recall them, and
the more of a positive effect they will have on your existence.
For instance, if you win a very competitive game of something, it feels really wonderful for a
moment, perhaps hours, but the feeling wears off, not because it has to, but because you call it
less and less into your memory (and human beings have a saturation point for everything). I
think the reason winners look and act like winners is because they’ve won so many times, that
they are very ready to fall right into their “I have won” mode, even if they haven’t yet, because
their focus is on what they are used to (winning) and you see and feel it in their presence. The
inverse is true about losers. Thus, you must keep a daily journal of your magic moments (and set
out to create new magic moments) because they are what life and your memory is made of. Open
up your book sometime and take a good whiff of all the beautiful things that have happened in
your life. Don’t let them disappear just so you can let your memory get rusty. Create a reverse
journal highlighting all the beautiful things you can remember about your life before this date,
because if you don’t, one day you will not be able to remember them, and they will truly be lost
forever (unless you are lucky enough for someone else to have done this work for you).

### Complain Less

Complaining is describing an event in a negative tone with no indication of next steps to fix or
improve the situation.

### Practice Gratitude

Now we live in mega cities, and you have the option of living in a house someone else built,
eating delicious food someone else prepared, and watching a mirror as someone else cuts your


hair with expert precision. How is this possible? Specialization. People get good at a couple
things instead of being bad or average at lots of things. The end result is that all the goods and
services we enjoy today are better than they could ever be if you had to do it all yourself. We
stand on the backs of giants. The masses and masses of our ancestors who fought, lived and died
so that we could have the life and lifestyles we have today. Honor the past and honor the
memory of all those that died and fought so hard to allow you the privilege of living this fine life.

### Appreciate More...................................................................................................................

Emotions are faster than thought. Literally, emotions are closer to the stem of your brain than
all the fancy thinking things, and so it takes longer to react and transmit commands than it does
to simply “feel.” And it should.

### You Are Important

If you’re not willing to cut off your arm to feed other people, then by golly perhaps you’re not
willing to just give away other things you own to them either. Perhaps executing that obvious
fact is why nearly all the good stuff on this planet is the result of men organized in businesses
with ownership and property enforced. As long as everything good in the world is made in that
way, then you should find a way to do more of what works faster than doing what doesn’t work,
and hasn’t worked for the most part, throwing money into places where it isn’t used properly.
It’s no accident that businesses beat out selfless endeavors for making the world a better
place. There’s no comparison at all. Remember the “One laptop per child” program? Ever see
one? Ever touch one? Ever use one? And that was one of the better ideas! The free market is the
most powerful way we’ve found to fulfill the desires of the masses. Not the needs, but the
desires. Getting them to desire what they should desire is currently their own problem, and the
intelligent marketers in the world are usually working against the consumers’ best interests.
These days the marketers are winning big time over the wholesome individuals’ ideal behaviors.
Call what the world of marketing out there what you like, many can tell you that if you
designed the system from the ground up yourself, you’d probably not have everyone spending
large percentages of their conscious life putting on a false face, hair, smell, etc., to trick their
fellow man. It’s kind of like the Cold War; if everyone would chill out with the arms race of


personal appearance, everyone could relax a bit, and our desires would renormalize, to back
when everyone had pubic hair but were still quite horny.

### Pity the Crab Louse

For those of you that haven’t gotten out and about in the world these days, there’s so little
pubic hair in Western culture that the crab louse is going extinct.
Now, Wikipedia says that there’s no data for it, but noticing the recent hairless trend, the crab
louse would have to be going homeless at an alarming rate, if they need hair to live in. Now Wiki
says they can’t tell because governments don’t track it, and some would argue they’re likely not
trying hard enough. Sales figures for common treatments, or surveying primary care physicians
and students regarding the status of that ailment should be little different from the queries they
execute for other ailments, STDs and drug use? If you’re curious, just ask.
Scivive won’t bother searching for a compelling reason that the destruction of this creature’s
habitat would have effects any dissimilar than the many other creatures who’ve had their habitats
destroyed, except of course that these things are blood sucking parasites, so good riddance.

### Solve Today’s Problems Today

Extinction level events would be a cool way to invest, (better than hedonism from the
perspective of an individual) but it is a slippery slope to care about the people so very far in the
future. Let’s say, however, that you did care about raw numbers and masses of people coming
after you, shouldn’t you be breeding with everything that moves and maximizing your child
output? The Quiverfull Christian sect does exactly that, pumps out the maximum number of kids
possible. If you really care about the largest biomass of humans in the future, you should
probably outlaw contraception as well. Might make procreating required by law and abstinence
punishable by death. Perhaps that should help expand the population too. How stupid...
Every sperm isn’t sacred, boys, and much of the effort you put into the future fiction fantasy
world will kill progress that could be made now, or in the next 20-40 years. Focus on the
problems you actually have. Focus on getting to the gym and lifting the weights and eating right.
Don’t worry about how you’ll fit through doorways when you’re bigger and stronger than
Arnold Schwarzenegger was—you won’t be. You’re solving a problem you’re never going to


have. Solve the problems in order. Solve the damn problems you must solve to earn your next
problem even existing. Solve today’s problems today.
They say the coward dies a thousand deaths, because one feels fear and imagines terrible fates
often, thus destroying what could be a good life if one had some courage. The courageous person
dies only once. Stop being a pussy in regards today’s problems by time-shifting your focus to the
fantasy problems of the future. You’ll find that a lot of those problems may solve themselves in
ways that you couldn’t have predicted.
Imagine if you were spending big money on punch cards and vacuum tubes, you’d have
wasted time perhaps optimizing for technology that paradigm shifts made useless. Find the best
method to get people to care more about themselves and their families and the here and now, and
not people thousands of years from now. It’s like people choosing the imaginary people of
Narnia or some other fiction novel over the real living people of this world. Don’t worry about
the fictional characters, we’ll deal with them when they’re closer to existing.

## The Myth of Equality

Equality is a widely believed myth. Equality doesn’t exist, not even two foot-long rulers are
the same size. If they appear the same size or weight to you, it’s only because you are bad at
measuring things.
Since two pieces of matter cannot occupy the same space at the same time, by definition
everything is not equal, because everything is closer to some things and farther from other
things. There are other situations where humans try to force equality where it would actually do
harm. If you take the concept of pair bonding for social mating and rearing of children, when you
remove specialization and attempt to make both members of the party good at the same things,
you sacrifice the breadth of ability that comes from specializing in different areas. Men are
supposed to do the heavy lifting, quite literally, which is why their muscles are bigger. Women
are supposed to do the breastfeeding which is why their breasts make milk. The hunt for equality
where there should be specialization does harm, not good.
The art is to avoid thinking that specialization is subjugation. Different doesn’t imply
hierarchy. In some places hierarchy is surely implied, however. Who should do the fighting?


Men or women? Hand to hand combat? Who looks more able? Who wins in these matches in the
real world?

### Reciprocity

Usually, equality exists in theory. If I push this direction, there’s an equal and opposite force.
Equality is useful for physics, equality is useful for finding things that are similar. You must be a
believer in equality to execute reciprocity. If the other teammates that you’re interacting with
realize that you don’t believe in reciprocity, and try to excel far beyond the equal, they will
punish you. You will become hated for trying to gain the system. When you cut in line, everyone
hates you because they knew you cut in line and your experience was unequal to (not as difficult
as) theirs. Scivive will tell you that in the search for equality, trying to make all lifestyle paths
the same is pretty stupid, all lifestyles paths are not the same. If you indulge in heroin, the
lifestyle path that you have chosen is pretty stupid, and you are going to bring a lot of pain to
yourself and to anyone else around you, and your life is likely to be very short because you chose
the wrong path. If you chose ultraviolent dictator, you’re going to die pretty early. If you chose
to be the President of the United States, you’re 100 times more likely to die than the average
person. Those people get assassinated all the time. A lot of the decisions you make that you want
to think are equal because of some desire to be fair to the world is a disservice to those around
you and yourself.
All choices are not the same, all paths are not the same. It is worth dedicating a great deal of
time on “better and worse exists”; that different exists, because the whole world is so trapped in
finding equality where it doesn’t belong that people are filled with delusion.

### Competition

If equality exists, why is there a Michelin star rating? Why do people use brands? Why do
they Choose cheerios instead of tasteless oats? Why do they listen to different genres of music?
Equality doesn’t exist, competition exists. Competition is where items or aspects of life that need
refurbishing get demolished by the thing that’s good. Natural, and unnatural selection at its
finest.


If you think equality exists, it’s because you are bad at measuring. Two rulers are not the
same size, you just think they are because your measuring tools suck. If you are able to create
equality at such a high degree, at such a high level you positively impact everyone else, because
now people know that’s possible.

### Better and Worse Exist.........................................................................................................

If everyone’s life is worth the same value, then what is a nation-state, and what is a family?
It’s quite obvious we hold different standards for those people which you exclude out of your
circle, not only personal living quarters, but even anyone regionally near you.
It seems slightly absurd that people are so cowardly and so fearful of finding better in their
life that they’re willing to brainwash and convince themselves that better doesn’t even exist,
can’t be measured and therefore whatever they’re doing is already awesome because there’s no
such things as better, just different. Computers are better calculators than abacuses, OLED screen
is better than the LCD screen, and if you want documents to last a long time, the pen is better
than the pencil; and if you want to hear loud music, some speakers are better than others. Better
and worse exists.
We can look at this from another perspective also. One could take the whiny, irritated
complaint about the world position, or take a more advanced, position that explains how lucky
are you that you get to build free yes momentum and free authority by building off of something
simple that these people already actually know to be true. And so, how lucky are you that you
can win a seemingly contentious point easily by showing that better and worse obviously exists
and then building upon it for your next thing. So, you had to build yes momentum anyway. You
had to get an opposing argument to pre-commit to agree with you anyway by finding that first
common ground. How lucky are you that the first common ground is so easy to find?
If you want to talk about how unfair the world is, it is designed in such a way that two pieces
of matter couldn’t exist at the same space, at the same time. This means there’s literally an
enforced uniqueness of one thing per location, how can that possibly be fair? That thing’s
location has got to be slightly better or worse than someone else’s. Time and space itself starts
out as unfair so stop looking for fairness.
Finnish women live on average six years longer than men. That’s 77.8 to 83.8 years. Where’s
the Scandinavian equality everyone is clamoring for?


The silly search for equality and other pattern finding tendencies, often you will see patterns
where none exist. It can be useful and it can be harmful. The lion is not the tiger and the antelope
is neither still. No one cares about those far off years. Everyone cares about today, so let’s make
today kick ass. Let’s work on vanity for fun. If girls can pay thousands a month to plaster over
wrinkling skin, they can surely pay to have genuinely wrinkle free skin without the makeup.

### The Fallacy of the Golden Rule

“Do onto others as you would have them do on to you.”
We are not all the same, we should not all be treated the same. Some things that you would
love, others would hate; roller coasters, gluten, etc.

### Inflation Vs. Deflation

When you’re looking at economic policies, or policies in general really, it’s a bit conceited to
want the same things for everyone else that you want of yourself. Take for instance inflation
versus deflation. Most would prefer deflation for their currency, wanting its value to go higher
and higher. For everyone else, however, you may prefer that theirs go lower and lower, because
it will amplify the amount of trade and creation that those people in that economic situation
create. I think that overall inflation is great because it robs from the hoarding people who don’t
want to give their money to someone else for goods and services.
Inflation works like the memory of someone else, where you lend them your lawnmower, and
then you have to borrow your own lawnmower back from them. That’s what inflation is, the
world owes you something, because you have the money that you worked hard for, but as long as
you don’t claim the favor back, it erodes over time until you are owed nothing anymore. Hold for
too long and you can’t afford to buy anything with the money that you saved because of the
inflation.
Ego is the power other people have over you. Significance is the power other people have
over you.
How the “-isms” and “-ities” affect real world.
In an endless sea of perspectives, but with limited knowledge and limited time to improve,
measure, and compare our models of the world, it is best to choose the perspective which profits


you the most. Let me give you an example; one could make two statements that are obviously
true, and yet contradictory. Look before you leap, and he who hesitates is lost. Or, money is the
root of all evil, and he who has the money makes the rules. Or, the early bird catches the worm
and some euphemism about patience. How about don’t put all your eggs in one basket, vs put all
your eggs in one basket and watch it very carefully. All of these perspectives could ring true
depending on circumstance. Most notably, the circumstances pertaining to your ability to execute
one or the other based on your own skill set. Choose your perspectives wisely.

## Personal Beliefs.......................................................................................................................

### Horoscopes

The zodiac and the concept of a horoscope dividing everyone on earth into 12 groups and then
giving them some vague crap predictions about their futures is pretty stupid. Do you really think
that if such predications were true, that all of mankind could be divided into twelve? And why
can’t you ask for better details? Why isn’t anyone named specifically like, “XYZ dude is going
to shoot up a school today.”

### Superstition

It’s funny how superstitious we are, with chain letters, post in this thread or you mom will die
in her sleep tonight, step on a crack break your momma’s back, and those obviously false little
hints surely do inspire action.

### What Are the Odds?

Hitchens and Dawkins appear to be impressed by the argument that the odds are so against us
existing, that it seems the game is rigged for us to exist.
This is just confirmation bias, just as any horse picker can send out 100 pieces of mail
choosing a winner, then another 100, then another 100, and some random person will be the
recipient of four picked winners in a row. That’s because the cost of picking a winner at random
is about zero. That’s why trustable signaling needs to be costly. Just because the universe tried
something one zillion times in a row, and you just happen to have received the letter that was all


winners in a row, doesn’t mean it was built for you. Also, how special would you consider the
living beings that dominated this planet for thousands of times longer than you? Dinosaurs—and
how did that work out for them?

### Fate and Control

If you believe that you don’t have much control over your life, you become discouraged,
because if you don’t have any control, you can’t make anything better. If you can’t ever improve
anything, well, your life might not be fulfilling. Now what if you had a different belief? Even a
belief that you had to stretch to make fit, a belief that you did control certain things in your life
even if you really didn’t, but you could slightly influence them and you called it control, what
kind of effect would that have?
As an example, let’s say you didn’t want to get hit by a car, what could you do? You could
not be around cars and live on an island without them, or you could travel at night when there’s
not so many cars around, or if you’re driving your own car you could paint it bright yellow.
There are a hundred options you could try that wouldn’t actually cost that much that would
greatly reduce the chance that you ever experience a car accident, and that same type of
creativity and responsibility can apply anywhere in your life.
You have a drinking problem? What’s the problem? Alcohol is near your hand, your hand
grabs it and puts it in your body, how do we get the hand further from the alcohol? You could
chop your hands off, or you could go somewhere where there isn’t alcohol, or you could find an
empowering meaning that you felt stronger about through deep soul searching than the reason
you are reaching for the drink. More people in the world need to take responsibility for what’s
happening to them in their own lives. Responsibility for oneself is absolutely massive, so if you
want to live longer, then maybe watching the Discovery channel is not enough, maybe being part
of what the Discovery channel is covering would be better, and is that not an option? Can you
not invest in one of the stocks, can you not put 5% of your money into one of these companies
that could one day save your life? That responsibility is a very strong part of the argument.
Tony Robbins’s limiting beliefs: if you don’t think you have any, you just found your first
one.


### Electric Cars, Excellence, Habits, Meditation

The risk-to-reward ratio during advancement gets crappier and crappier for any kind of
improvements in life. By definition, doing better in life implies that you have already obtained
more of the set of the good stuff, which is a finite set, whereas you have had the minimum of the
bad stuff in the risk category, and therefore the farther along you go, the easier it gets to find
things in the much more under achieve risk set, and the harder it is to make gains in the farther
success set. For example, should you try psychedelic drugs to become more creative? If you
already have a great mind, perhaps you lose your drive, or have a really bad trip, and you go
from a nice productive guy that only wanted to create cooler and better ideas for the world
through a creativity assister, a chemical, but you end up like the Unabomber instead, really
intelligent yet dangerous and evil. Now is that to say it’s a common outcome for people that have
tripped? (“Tripped” meaning that a person has had a psychedelic experience.) Well, how much
do you want to risk? If you are already inadequate, and are likely to continue to be, perhaps you
have more to gain by risky changes to brain chemistry, or risky experiences that you may
enlighten the world about.
For a better analogy, if you’re already dating a super model who loves you, is honest and
caring, and can be a great mother, how much do you gain by trying to upgrade, and how much do
you risk?
Surely you can come up with a scenario where you would suggest to someone that they not
mess up a good thing. You will find that the validity of that advice increases the better the good
thing is, and the more likely the inverse is to become the reality, or have more tragic amplitude.
This is why Scivive has no interest in suggesting what is so commonly suggested by many
others in regards to sensory deprivation tanks, or gurus, or meditation, or all of the other new age
and rarely effective isolation behaviors. If you want trance, and alteration of consciousness, the
least risky way to get there is dance/chanting/singing. It occupies the mind and feels good.
Some young folks like to combine those things with some chemicals like MDMA, and claim
to have the same near soulful experiences of those on more psychedelic substances. If meditation
was so bad ass, why are the Tibetan monks not crushing it on the world stage? Most inventions,
the best health, best science, and most advanced philosophy, or fastest rates of progress in
economic, culinary, and musical areas are not usually attributed to monk lifestyle. They’re rather


stagnant and getting stomped by nearly everyone else that doesn’t meditate. Well why would one
want to adopt and or maximize what appears to be an ineffective behavior in one’s own life? So
that one may trade real world useful behavior and growth for the illusion of usefulness?
Is it better to trick yourself into thinking that you’re doing great things, when in reality you’re
sitting uselessly, leeching the resources and productivity out of the other people in the world that
actually keep you safe and develop the music and literature you might enjoy, only to give little to
nothing back in return except perhaps the observable warning you leave that life truly can be
wasted?
Not realizing your underachieved status is one way to do it, and enhances the likelihood that
you continue to underachieve until the day you die. You’ve found a way to be content with
sucking, and continue to lie to yourself about your own reality.
If you’re not giving back to the world that brought you into it, and gave you roads to walk on,
understandings to learn and benefit from, a nice language to speak, beautiful art and music to
immerse yourself in, and a body not riddled with bullet holes or under Nazi government control,
you are an ass. Many good men fought and were tortured and died so that you could have the
rather awesome quality of life that you get to enjoy today, and meanwhile you disrespect their
sacrifice and quite literally throw your life in the garbage and waste it, by giving little to nothing
back. To what degree are you doing these people a favor by allowing their enduring pain or
achievements to go unnoticed? You don’t help them or anyone else by speaking well of things
that are sick.
Improper tolerance or ignorance of the real effects that occur in this world because the
decisions people and religions and belief systems cause to be executed is the road to damnation.
Perhaps the Tibetan pacifist monks actually did do something to free the world of Nazism and
genocide. One would have to say it seems unlikely they were useful. If you’re looking for people
who take more than they give, and aren’t doing what they should or could to make this world a
better place, you really don’t need to look far, the jails have tons of them behind their bars, and
perhaps we are all guilty of this impropriety ourselves from time to time. Let’s call the crap what
it is, find it and cut it out where reasonable.
Some experimentation in the areas of uselessness is actually useful; however, it should be
kept to a minimum for the likelihood that useless behavior remains useless, is greater than the
likelihood that a great discovery is made.


## Frameworks, Behaviors, Robustness, Triggers

### Frameworks

These ideas, these things, these side benefits that come from smoking, you would only discover
them if you know how to ask the right questions. Now, one framework that is useful for asking
these types of questions is an incorrect framework which, is a good third party framework that
has shown to actually analyze a behavior; see what the side benefits that are useful are and try
and replace it with another behavior that meets those same benefits at a lower cost or at a higher
enjoyment level.
Let’s compare two frameworks for analyzing human needs. By the way, these human needs
things, 1: Presuppose that human beings have these needs, which is up for debate. 2: They
presuppose that those needs are constant and not ever changing. There’s a whole other set of
lines to the human being which is the most conscious, rather the most complicated conscious,
living, thinking entity that we’re aware of in the universe, to think that such a thing only has in
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, seven or eight however are them are in there. Or, in Tony
Robbins’s contrived world, human invented, not really well researched scientifically system of
needs.
Let’s put Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in regards to analyzing the side benefits of smoking,
or even call them all benefits, there’s no reason to call them “side.” We only call them side
because they’re benefits to people that might miss, “Oh, it feels good.” Well, is there anything
else it does? You know, scratching your back feels good too but it appears to be less addictive
than smoking so there’s obviously something else going on there.
Here’s Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs versus cigarettes. Okay, are cigarettes food? No.
Shelter? Nope. Self-actualization? Maybe you could stretch that one in there. Love? No. So far in
this exercise we’re not really getting a lot of useful detail out of applying Maslow’s Hierarchy of
Needs to the behavior of smoking. What you’ll find is you won’t get much of a benefit out of
applying Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs to anything, which is a reason when you’re done learning
them in school, you never see them again. That stuff is too remedial. If there were huge swarms
of people out there who weren’t able to self-actualize, weren’t able to find shelter, and weren’t
able to eat, then that framework would be much more useful. However, since you as a person are


lucky enough to read this book you probably already have shelter and aren’t using the book to
shield yourself from the rain, then you need to use the framework that’s more applicable.
Maslow’s is hard to apply in the real world.
So, let’s look at Tony Robbins. Tony believes that there’s certainty and variety, significance
and connection, and those things are all paradoxical. So, if you become too significant, people
remove connections. If you become too needy, then people don’t think you’re important, you
lose significance. And the same goes for certainty and variety. If you do the same thing all the
time, then it’s boring because you’re not getting variety. If all you ever have is adventure and
craziness, then you may develop a post-traumatic stress because you don’t have enough
certainty. Then he would like to believe that growth and contribution are the two needs of spirit,
and not the four previous needs of the personality or identity.
Now, it’s interesting enough that Robbins is in the business of selling personal growth, and it
would be pretty awesome if people had that as a need—their most fulfilling of needs—and the
more time they spent on growth and contribution, the more fulfilled they would be.
Consequently, since we have finite time, the less time they spent with certainty, significance,
variety and connection. So, Scivive doesn’t agree with Robbins’s system completely though the
system is still more applicable than Maslow’s and is still very useful.
Why bother mentioning this to you? You will find frameworks of understanding,
categorization and maximization that allow you to build categories of things and look through
that lens at something. Some of those frameworks are useful, some of them are not. If you have
an infrared camera and you’re in the Arctic, and everything is the same temperature, it’s not that
useful. There’s nothing to be really looking at. If you have an infrared camera and you’re in a
wooded area and there are animals that are generating heat, then the infrared camera is much
more useful, and in that environment infrared is a great lens to look through because the animals
will stick out massively.
What you discover is just like animals can hear at different frequencies, they can see at
different frequencies. Some can see polarization while human beings can’t. Some animals can
see into the infrared, human beings can’t. Actually with surgery in the future you might be able
to, but currently you cannot and you probably wouldn’t want to anyway.
If you look out into space infrared is really useful, if you’re looking at whether people have
viruses and their immune systems is responding with a fever and you want to quarantine them if


there’s a swine flu epidemic, it’s really cool to have an infrared thermometer that you can just
point at someone’s mouth without having physical contact with them. If you need to make a new
non virus- contracting method that allows you to see in other people’s mouths then infrared is
awesome.
However, if you’re a normal human being and not really so concerned with the temperature
of everything around you, you just care about friend or foe; edible not edible, things like that,
maybe it’s more useful that you don’t see in the limited infrared spectrum. So, what’s the point?
Organizing the world and looking through that lens of organization has a massive effect in
your ability to act and perceive. The frames and lenses which you use to see the world directly
affect the number of actionable behaviors that are presented for you.
If you’re a musician and any new thing that happens to you, you perceive the lens of timing,
amplitude and timbre, then you’re going to be accumulating excellence in that area which you
might be able to execute in the future. However, if you’re constantly focused on the way things
sound and you’re listening as hard as you can with your eyes closed, you’re going to be missing
out on much of the visual world. Therefore, you’re likely to be a mediocre artist because you’re
less good at color and only focused on audio. Perhaps this is the reason that most musicians
aren’t great painters. Perhaps this is the reason that most great book writers aren’t great painters
or great musicians.
To be a polymath and amazing at more than one thing is pretty hard to do. It really takes all
of your consciousness and all of your focus on a single thing. To become amazing at it? Well.
You don’t get to do two things great, you only get to do one thing great. Thus, you must choose
very carefully the lenses you use to see the reality, the frameworks, shortcuts, prejudices and
pigeon holing of people and categorizing of people. All of those things that you use to
understand the world that you live in... And it’s more than understand it. If your eyes see a thing,
then you start to assign meanings and beliefs to the thing.
In this world, you actually don’t get to control what your eyes even see. And so, you not only
have the filter of belief and the filter of meaning, but you also have the choice as to what even
gets put into that filtering system. Thus, choose the most powerful and useful belief systems,
hopefully ones that have been proven to be useful for others. Values, meanings, shortcuts of
categorization, shortcuts of prejudice, shortcuts of wanting to be good at these things and no
other things.


Those calculations will make huge impacts and differences in your life, and since we don’t
exist in a vacuum and much of our consciousness is affected by our family, our friends, and who
we spend time with, when you hear commonly held beliefs such as the amount of money you
make is the average of your four best friends, you may think, why is that? Because those are the
people that are going to affect what you focus on, what you do and what you see as actionable
behavior based on the inputs that you allow into your mind. Whatever allowed them to achieve
success is likely to rub off on you.
And so, not only are your beliefs, your values and what you focus on an influencing factor in
your life, but so are the people that are nearest to you because they will trigger you in ways that
may be both positive and negative. If you spend time with friends that are rather free flowing
with the new things, they want to tell you about all the new things they want to believe. The less
specific and less scientific they are about it, their one hour of watching something believable and
interesting on television, turns into 12 hours of you disproving it for them. You develop with that
person an asymmetrical relationship, which is a little bit okay for an author, but unless you’re
harnessing that energy to benefit the world somewhere else, you can end up wasting a lot of
time.
You could say Tony Robbins’s “Six Human Needs” psychology is much very useful
psychology for needs, but it’s very wishful. For instance, certainty and variety could also be
called fear and greed, because variety just means do different from what you’re currently doing,
which is caused by greed, and then only doing the same thing that you’ve been doing is caused
by fear. Another thing to say is that those two definitions are so vague as to apply to all
behaviors, which is basically do the same thing or do a different thing. Now there’s a lot of
people that don’t really ever try different things, and so the needs of growth and contribution you
could say are very wishful. Now, perhaps he says that growth and contribution are optional, but
those other four - certainty, variety, significance, and connection - perhaps he refers to them as
the needs of the identity. He also states that one of the most important needs that you have is to
remain consistent with what you think your identity is, which is interesting, because perhaps that
would also have to be called certainty. However, it really seems like a cop-out because any
complex system, particularly a human being, probably has a lot more than four inputs and
weightings that it’s using to measure and controlling the actions it takes. To tell you the truth,
that’s what feelings and emotions are. If you were going to say that human beings had needs,


which could be a misnomer, you must question that we even have needs. Maybe just have
behaviors.

### Side Benefits of Behaviors

Let’s say you want to change your behavior. Behaviors have side benefits. There was a study
done on people who claimed they had cancer even though they really didn’t, and they tried to
figure out why someone would lie about something that is so important. What they discovered
was that part of the reason someone would lie about having cancer when they didn’t have it was
because it was the only time that their family called; and it was the only time that they felt
important; and it was the only time that they felt part of their family’s lives. So, that problem, the
terrible problem, they had to will into seeming to exist in the real world because it paid in real
world benefits.
Same with smoking—it pays real world benefits. It gives you a temporary excuse to stop
doing something that you dislike. It gives you an excuse to go out with people and talk to them
when you may otherwise feel uncomfortable by not having a common activity to perform with
them. It gives you the ability to perform a ritual which makes you look cool to other people and
allow you to feel cool through having this ritual and good marketing on the behalf of the tobacco
companies to make it look cool so that you can be associated with the Marlboro man; a tough
and rugged persona who needs nothing, who’s very useful and powerful and confident.

### Robustness

You can’t enforce optimal charitable choices amongst all the citizenry. Humans are built to be
robust, and robustness requires that we all have slight differences in desires and efficacy so that
we can find optimal paths, or create them where they can be made. If everyone felt the same way
about everything, it would leave us open to more risk and less excellence. Living things have
mutations to find excellence, we have experimentation, and we all have chance and luck.
If you’re curious, the relationships that you should have with behaviors that make you feel
different, whether that’s singing songs you like or reading cool interesting facts and news or
being around people that respect you and make you feel good, you should really take a look at
how your body and your psychology respond to increasing dosages of those things at increased


frequency. You might find that there’s a minimum effective dose. For friendship, there might be
a minimum effective dose for singing. Then, as you go over that minimum effective dose, you
get diminishing returns and as you go beyond diminishing returns, into the negative. Now your
voice doesn’t work anymore because you sang too loud for too long. Now your friends are bored
of you because you are around them too long.
What’s the point? In life, your body is a self-correcting, self-regulating, basically conscious
actor. Without stretching the use the word conscious too far, it has its own agenda, whether it’s
conscious of it or not, and it wants you to do things a certain way.
What would you do if you wanted to create an Elon Musk twenty years before he was born?
How would that occur? It would be very useful to have a great school for him to be able to
attend. Apparently it would be very useful to have some interesting science fiction for him to
read and enjoy. Then, later on in life, the existence of a science related massively profitable IPO
and public company exits along with capitalism would allow such a man to execute his dreams
without the assistance of the government in some cases. If one were to ask you twenty years
before he was born, the best way to create him, would science fiction have made into your
answer? And would venture capital have made it into your answer? Is it likely that the next Elon
Musk that gets created twenty years from now will be influenced by the same exact set of things,
or will something occur between now and twenty years from now when said person is identified
through success to be what it is that you wanted to create, and is he of the right framework? Are
there other people that have arrived at excellent behavior outcomes through separate inputs?
Further still, can great outcomes be had without the hero worship and cult of personality that
follows a single individual? Or is it that one human accomplishes so much without a following
that actually paves the way of progress in this world?

### Know Thyself and Thy Potential

There are two things that aren’t fair.
One is that you are too cowardly to admit how great any human being’s potential can truly be,
and that any one of us with enough dedication and drive could truly impact millions of people’s
lives, both today and in the future, through creation of film, book, music, the spreading of a
unique idea. There’s so many ways that we can affect those near us and in perpetuity into the
future, and it’s unfair to not be aware of that.


It’s also unfair to focus on something that is so hard, nearly unobtainable for much of the
world, and to feel bad if you don’t obtain that. There is art and magic to knowing what you are
capable of, and what is reasonable or even unreasonable, but worth trying to do, and still feel
good while failing, because you are going to fail a lot along the way. In explanation, there is
what you can and can’t do, and there is what you think you can and can’t do. It would be a
miracle if you were completely correct in knowing what you could or couldn’t do, thus we must
all take calculated risks, and reach as far as our arms will allow, to see what we might grasp. We
can stand on the shoulders of friends and the great men that came before us, and reach higher
than we ever thought possible. Shakespeare had a nice turn of words when he said, “Do not find
yourself. Create yourself.”
Silicon Valley is about getting rich by giving people what they want or could be addicted to,
instead of what they should want. Sadly, the battle to better the common man is costly, and
where should the money come from to do it? Ideally, businesses could find a way to empower
people for profit rather than weaken people for profit. The mindless numbing of our future
generations is truly a tragedy.
When you listen to music, to some degree that’s what you’re doing. You are executing
someone else’s software for you. When you watch a movie, you are executing someone else’s
software for you. You hope they have positive intentions for you, you hope that they want you to
have positive experiences, because we have good peer review they usually do, which can warn
you if a particular piece is garbage. You might listen to a friend’s movie review and reply, “Oh,
you watched it and it wasn’t good? Thanks for saving my time.” But in the end, you’re living
someone else’s life. You’re living what they gave you, though their advice, their lensing. Maybe
it’s a wonderful gift, or maybe at some point, you’ve run out of time now. You may have
enjoyed the ride, but no one else will get to enjoy your ride now. You had a chance to build a
nice ride for the rest of the world to make the world a better place, to give back to the people that
gave to you. You had that chance, and instead you just took and never gave. You ate up the
music, you ate up the language you ate up the education, you ate up the recipes, and then you
took it with you when you died. You didn’t give anything back. If you don’t show people the
detriment of their ways, and there is profit in them executing those ways, they will certainly run
those programs. If people see profit in being corrupt, they will do it. It’s one’s duty to show them
a better way. Stop living everyone else’s program for you. Build your own program. Stop


absorbing everyone else’s content to the exclusion and deletion of yourself. Have balance—give
and take. Absorb. Build. Mix. Extend. Expand. Give back to the world.

```
Whatever it is that you are trying to do to make a big impact on the world, you are going to be
faced with challenges, you are going to need to have internal drive and self-reliance, or an
exceptionally helpful peer group that can help you get to that level.
I used to wish my father had a made a larger impact on the world. I wished he were the
descendant of some type of royalty, noble upbringing or lineage. In reality, my father is a hard-
working, loving, caring, honest man who has worked hard every day of his entire life. I really
mean every single day. I wouldn’t want to rob him of the potential to do something even more
amazing with his life, by just not thinking enough of him to even think it possible, nor do I want
him to feel even the slightest bit of sadness for choosing to lead an honest hardworking life.
As you grow up, you have so much that you want. You want your freedom, you are tired of so
many people having so much power over you. Due to the luck of the draw, some of you will
have great parents, some not so great, and some none at all. Some of you will get great advice,
some terrible, and some only silence. GREAT NEWS! You are about to get some life changing
advice.
There exists a duality of death and how it relates to courage. Some people have the courage to
face death and fight for their country, or perform other courageous acts. Other people may lack
the courage to face life’s challenges, and instead are cowards and choose death over continued


struggle. It’s an odd duality that in one case the courageous person may die anyway, for example
in a war, and in one case the courageous person lives. Humanity’s courage to discover the world
is eventually inevitable, that is obvious and will happen regardless of whether we want it to or
not, in pursuit of places where we may live longer and find new ways of life as we always have.
In this case, death due to exploration of the unknown is a courageous action, and in this case, the
cowardly action occurs when one chooses death over struggle and expansion. In our needlessly
early and perhaps painful death that comes as a result of not putting up a fight and pretending
that bad things aren’t going to happen and that nothing can be done about them. That pretending
is cowardice.
If you think the lives of yourself and the people like yourself are worth more, consider these
things instead: Being a man or a woman is a unique experience, and your life and thoughts are
likely to not be exactly like anyone else that has ever existed. Because of that, it would be quite
silly to waste time writing a book that everyone was supposed to read the same way. Some
people, perhaps you, will benefit from reading some parts of this book more than others. Perhaps
the order in which you consume this information improves digestion based on your unique
perspective and life experience.
Perhaps the two major themes are feelings vs. reason. Art is feelings and science is reason.
There are other giant ones in here, like religious vs. non-religious, rich vs. poor, tit for tat vs. tit
for two tats. Political orientation, gender... So many variables! Perhaps this is why books are
rarely written from a race, gender perspective? Maybe the authors just weren’t flexible enough.
If it is the case that this type of unique specialization in framing similar concepts is possible, then
it should be demonstrable on a small scale.
Do you believe that you should have the right to have kids? Do you believe it was a good
thing that you were born? Do you believe you have the right to decide who else is allowed to
have kids? Do you believe in the right for an individual to have a chance at life, perhaps even a
chance at a good life?
You would be surprised at the range of opinions here. Hard questions. Is being overweight
dangerous to your health? If your health is impaired by self-abuse, should you have the right to
medical care? Is it reasonable then that those whose lives you will impact and time you will
consume through being sick, have a right to impose healthy things on you because you will be
screwing them over with your risky behavior or unhealthy eating? Should you have the ability to


opt out of the social safety net, because you’re comfortable doing unhealthy and risky things and
didn’t ask anyone to take care of you? Should the present-day you be able to make that decision
for future you? Who gets to be the health czar?
If health is such an important part of life, and it can be influenced with science, why don’t we
mandate a science production quota, or labor quota, as we do forcing kids to learn other
languages? There is a line that must be drawn between what it is worth to sacrifice for, and for
how much sacrifice.
Here is a gigantic one. How many lives is your life worth? Would you die for your kids, your
parents? How about three random people, or three schoolmates? What about two guys you barely
knew? Two girls? Two kids that weren’t yours? What would you answer to this question in
public, versus what you would do if no one ever knew your decision? The answers to these
questions are really important, and there are people making exactly these answers every day,
whether they realize it or not.
You probably know some of the easier answers for yourself. You believe your life is worth
the most, but perhaps that will change when you have kids. For now, you must exist. Then comes
your loved ones, your mate, then your kin (parents), then people you like, then people you know,
then everyone else. Some people would put animals pretty high on this list as well. One wouldn’t
be surprised if many people put animals before people they would never meet.
What research gets funding? Which countries get invaded? Is non-vaccination punishable by
law, how punishable? How far should dragnet surveillance actually go? Is there an objective
method by which you could know which of these personal beliefs caused the best emergent
outcomes for all participants in the system? Could it perhaps be a mixed, evolving belief where
people had different ones at different times would be best? It seems as though that is how life is
designed, you go from an all-powerful god to a god that the leads and cares and is merciful, but
you can’t start there, you have to go through power god first.

### Do You Matter?....................................................................................................................

If it is the case that one percent of the world owns 90 percent of the stuff, then it’s quite likely
that that one percent gets to decide what the other 90 percent do with their time, more or less. As
such, if you want to make an impact in the world, then you probably need to start and finish with
the one percent. Now here’s an odd fact, if you didn’t know it, if you make over $ 31 ,000 per


year, you are in the one percent of the world. I find that knowing what percentage of the planet’s
wealth is stored in different owners is probably less valuable than knowing which small groups
in that large group you can successfully influence. Hell, there are probably some groups in there
that will actively try to bring you harm if they discover that what you are doing might cost them
their money.

### What Kind of Person Would You Like to Be?

Some think that you and your loved ones and your friends are worth more than people you
will never meet. One is not usually willing to accept death, or let one’s own family die, because
seamen somewhere else are having a bad time. Lucky for us, the rising tide usually rises all
ships. These things we do to help ourselves will almost always help others, not including some
exceptions to that rule like property rights. If you have the right to kick other people off a piece
of land, then you having that power is nearly exclusive of anyone else having it. In that case, we
really do have a battle of powers.

### The Illusion of Importance

For many successful people, they misattribute, along with many of their peers, the importance
they actually have to the company they founded or currently manage. Whether your company is
doing good things or not has much more to do with how you appear compared to your peers, in
that, if your peers suck, it’s very easy to look like a winner. However, if your peers are ass-
kicking machines, then even though ideally you should be happy with your performance, the
market may starve you out of existence.
Bill Burr has a pretty funny skit on how he thought Steve Jobs was a douchebag, and now
that he’s gone, look how the company has gone to shit. In reality, it was the hard work of many,
many other people that allowed those things to be created, and if he truly was integral to the
company’s wellbeing, should not the company be in dire straits now?
When you analyze someone, you may want to say a bunch of things to them that make you
sound insightful, as though you are able to identify specific traits in that person, because you
have a greater understanding. That then would give them credence to believe more of the things
that you said. Good liars mix in a lot of truth, the maximum amount of truth and the minimum


amount of lies, because if they test you, you pass more of the test because there’s more truth
density. Bullshit artists do the same thing when they’re bullshitting you. They tell you as many
non-testable good sounding things that they can so that they can get cool points and pass through
more of the bullshit, which doesn’t pass tests.
What are some standardized feel good, complementary, sound smart, intellectual mumbo
jumbo false truths that you can tell people that they love to hear? Because people have found
profit in believing that they are unique, special and deserve great resources, particularly more
resources than people who aren’t them, that may not be as great, they believe that consciousness
is something that is hard to understand, hard to measure.

### Confidence Leads to Excellence

Adopt increased behavioral variance and follow through volatility. Mutations that allow for
variation and robustness are the result of lacking self-doubt. The more self-doubt that you have,
the less decisive you are, the longer you remain in a non-mutated state, and thus the less
variation in behavior you will have. Thus, the less likely you are to become an outlier, or have
legendary robustness. This is closely related to analysis paralysis and the opposite of ready-fire-
aim.

### Fake It ‘til You Make It

The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure
while the intelligent are full of doubt.
“One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those
with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision.” — Bertrand
Arthur William Russell, New Hopes for a Changing World (1951).
“The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.” .— W. B.
Yeats, The Second Coming (1919).
“To understand the actual world as it is, not as we should wish it to be, is the beginning of
wisdom.” — Bertrand Arthur William Russell.

### Don’t Be a Scammer


It takes a lifetime to build a reputation, and only minutes to ruin it. Most great scammers
could have been greater business people instead.
You put yourself at odds with the most powerful tool any wealthy person has, the law.
Pay attention to what other people say about your attitude, it’s easier for them to see what
you’re doing than it is for you, you can’t even see your own face.
You’re too busy doing the feeling to notice that you’re doing it. It’s funny to watch people act
like they’re happy or fulfilled when you can tell they’re not. It’s like when your girlfriend tells
you nothing’s wrong when you ask her what’s wrong. Only after you beg, plead and cry might
you find out what was indeed wrong. Most people are bad actors.

## Trolley Problem, Morality, Decision Making, Values

The trolley problem is going to actually be executed in cars as decision logic.
Back to the trolley problem, let’s say you wanted to use brute forcing and creativity to create
a realistic set of possible factors which you could or should factor into your decisions regarding
the value of human life, the difference between persona action and inaction, the response of other
parties in the future to the survivors of the event, and getting caught or not caught, etc. You’ll
find that when you make it a specific goal to achieve, to expand the number of factors that you
consider, and the parties to which those factors could apply. Let’s give it a whirl so to speak.
Parties, person to be tested, we’ll call this poor bastard the “testee.”
In this analysis, as in so many other paradoxical questions, it seems as though the truly useful
data is left out of the question. Why should you value all human lives at the same value, which
we already know you do not? This is the reason you don’t let strangers into your home, because
they are worth less than family and worth less than yourself.
You’ll find that you’re much more likely to allow people into your home that you would like
to make love to, or are friends with, etc. Thus, it’s quite obvious that you have a process by
which you are used to deciding which other people in this world are worthy of sharing what little
time, space, or things you have with. Now, this thought experiment of a trolley could be a bad
example to start with, because we know much more about trains than trolleys in the western
world, as they’re much more common, and faster, and more dangerous, thus a much better
educational tool.


The experiment goes, if a runaway trolley was rushing towards four workmen working on
that track that would be unable to escape, and you could flip the switch causing the track to
switch to a different track where a single worker wouldn’t be able to escape, would you flip the
switch? Now what if instead of being at the switch, there was a fat man on a bridge over the
tracks, and you were standing near him, and you could push this fat man over the side and
somehow magically this would prevent the other four people dying? What a silly idea, fat men
nor cows nor cars are known to make much difference in the speed of an oncoming train
whatsoever. Anyway, for the sake of this poorly designed thought experiment, let’s grant them
their assumptions.
Would you push that fat guy?
Here is what should go into your considerations. If the fat man’s friends and family detect
that you have murdered their fat man, they’re going to rightly punish you, and use the state to
punish you for manslaughter. You can’t allow the silly people of this world to kill other people
because they thought it was useful for someone else to do so. If people believed that their
estimate of a greater good allowed people to be murdered, wow, you’d have a whole lot of
murdered people. It turns out that no man knows the future well enough to know that those other
people couldn’t have escaped the train, the train wouldn’t have been otherwise derailed, the
people you thought you saw were actually dummies and this was a test of some part of the train
and not real lives in danger, or that the impact, if unavoidable, would be fatal; perhaps they all
might just lose a leg.
Therefore, some might see this thought experiment being rather poorly formed for the
following reasons: You must not act, for you operate from incomplete knowledge. You must not
act, for you will personally be punished much more harshly than you will be rewarded. The four
you think you saved won’t pay you enough or protect you enough from the peers of the one that
you killed or law enforcement. The fat man wasn’t doing something risky and stupid, he was
only crossing a bridge, specifically out of the way of the train, whereas those other men earned
their fates by not respecting the train tracks, as is required by law and common sense.
If you choose the one over the four, haven’t you increased the chance that four more people
will make a life threatening decision by making someone else pay for their risky behavior? If the
reason this is a trolley moving at speed instead of something slower, is to try to limit your time to
think, and get you to be more emotional and less logical, which some believe is the point, it’s a


great thing that we have books, dreaming and education so that when these pressing, time
sensitive issues arise, we have already pre-calculated good action and good outcome beforehand.
Other than learning that this is a poorly formed thought experiment, which is supposed to
estimate how you as an individual value the weight of one anonymous person versus four
anonymous people, against the idea that you will be guilty by action for saving four, but killing
one, and guilty by inaction by allowing four to be killed but not killing one. One can only say
that it seems quite stupid to combine someone’s valuing of another’s fitness in regards to fat or
fit, pretty much destroys the information you would get regarding the one death through action
vs the four deaths through inaction. Couldn’t you just more easily ask, how much less value do
you see in fat people? Should they be punished for their lack of fitness? Perhaps if you didn’t
believe their answer, you could structure a superior thought exercise to derive their true feelings
on the matter.
In the end, Scivive sees very, very little use for this poorly formed thought exercise, it’s far
too removed from reality. Really, for any reasonable thinker, the fat man should never be
pushed. You will be guilty of manslaughter, and fat men don’t stop trains, or even slow them to
any useful degree.
In regards to the one versus four, you don’t have the data you’d need to make a good decision,
you don’t know they couldn’t escape, so you will yell and holler, but you won’t perform an
action that will once again lead to your personal annihilation by the state for manslaughter. The
law and society you live in has a much harsher penalty for causing harm through action
personally, than it does through watching as harm occurs, but being too much in shock to act.
You’ll do much less time in prison by non-action.
Now, is it fair to care more about your time in prison, perhaps alive but incarcerated, than it is
for you to care about those lives? Well yes, one must say that it is,
“We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal &
independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among
which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness.” — Declaration of
Independence.
If you believe the above line to be true, then you should value your own life as at least equal.
You aren’t risking your life on the tracks as they are, and you will be harshly punished for acting.
Anyway, it is a poorly designed experiment with some interesting discovery that the state has


already decided the matter for you, and people must pay personally for the risks they take.
Friends and family of deceased will harm you more than friends and family of survivors, for
vengeance has larger amplitude than favor. Those that will harm you are exponentially more
dangerous than those that will help you are useful. The harm hurts more than the help feels good.
Scivive would say that fixing the question, and looking at the system are two important steps
that seem to be left out of all the common teaching of logical thought. It seems like what’s most
common is to be more logically effective and tactical about the wrong questions, and not mindful
of the system as a whole. Do not trust the question, do not trust the data, know your desired
outcome in positive terms, and know the system.
This is how you get superior answers to those that came before you, because logic on its own
will not tell you to do these things at all. Logic is like a physical calculator; it only knows what
you key into it. Your hammer won’t ask you to use a different kind of nail, nor tell you how hard
to swing it.
If you want people to do something that isn’t done often, it’s really helpful to give a name to
that action you want them to do, and if you can define the term, then it becomes a memory
anchor in their mind, greatly enhancing the presence and identification and spread of the
behavior in the wild. Words need to exist to quickly describe the specific pre-work that needs to
be done before using the hammer of logic. We could also benefit from inventing a word for the
specific action of knowing which tool to use for a thing. Very specifically not requiring you need
to know how to use it, but that it exists and this is where it should be used.

## Tool Sense

Every other important domain of knowledge has a title. The concept that problem solving as a
domain or tool use as a domain doesn’t have a title is stupid. Thus, know which tool is right for
the job in your domain shall be called tool sense. Even if you don’t know how to use the tool,
you know it exists, what it’s good for, why it should it be used here, and therefore can find
someone to use it. Scivive should coin a term for the Meta layer of knowing when to use a tool,
what is the layer before the tool? What would one search for to discover if such a word may
already exist, and even if it does, if it were good, it would already be well known, therefore
likely not good and therefore likely needing made anew. What should one call this scope


expansion step? System/brute forcing (finding max quantity of) parties and variables in the
system/brute forcing (finding max quantity of) states or actions of the parties.
Then creating the table of all possible outcomes combining all the measureable outcomes
when all parties have all the states and all the actions they can perform in different orders and
combinations and locations, etc., to create a giant hard to understand mass of outcomes from
which you may filter those that are most desired. Creating that table is how you beat lots of
puzzles and logic questions and don’t miss non-obvious answers because you can’t miss an
answer, because you have the largest possible set to choose from.
Imagine you wanted to create a beautiful sculpture from a block of marble. If you start out
with a small block, you get only a small sculpture where the detail is hard to see, and you don’t
have the space you need to execute your vision. If you choose a larger block of marble, you will
end up with the fine details that people will enjoy with their naked eyes in person. If you start
with a mountain, you may get Mount Rushmore. The point is, the smaller and less stuff you have
to work with to create an idea, the less resistant to the elements and impressive your sculpture
will be. Expanding your set of variables and possibilities and externalities accounted for in the
work you do to find all the answers and outcomes possible to a situation is your block of marble.
Similarly, while you will have a more lasting and impactful creation, just like a large
sculpture, it will take you longer to create. Good, fast, cheap, you can have any two of the three.
In statistics they call this the probability space.

## Thinking From First Principles

Logic is a tool, and knowing when, where, and with what inputs towards what end is outside
its ability.
Forget their question. Make a better question.
If your first inclination upon hearing this trolley problem isn’t to attempt to ascertain more
relevant data about the parties involved, than you will be more unaware of the factors that you
should be including in your analysis. For instance, if you believe that people should take
responsibility for their own actions, and those people on the tracks chose to stand in that
dangerous place.
So the point is that, you know you do believe in responsibility, and you know this would be a
place where that belief should be used, however you never notice that responsibility is part of the


equation, because you’re so focused on the restrictions of the problem, and your role in it, that
you never arrive at thinking about what these people deserve outside the system of you and the
train and your decisions, but what they have earned in the system that isn’t mentioned, which is
the system of “deserving” and responsibility.
Thus due to the very wide range of things that can and are push and pull, give and take, earn
and not earn, fair and not fair in this world, one may believe it’s entirely required that you take a
moment to be mindful of all the surrounding, related, touching things that are tangential to what
you’re thinking about, without actually being the thing you’re thinking about. This idea of
mindfulness and holistic thought and being at least one extra level higher up and looking down
on a wider problem where the original parts become smaller parts of a larger functioning system
is how you make breakthroughs and discoveries that everyone else misses. Elon Musk calls this
thinking from first principles.
Sherlock Holmes said, “It’s elementary, my dear Watson.” Anyway, the summary is, if you
ignore all the other parts that touch and influence and are near a thing, you’ll rarely make the
best decision about the thing. That’s the kind of limiting logic that sees you remove one dictator
and see two worse ones being imposed, or you stop doing one bad habit, and instead pick up
another bad habit, which might have even been worse than the first.
Nature abhors a vacuum. Oddly enough, think about why this specific phrase might exist
“power vacuum.” If you see the whole system from one level higher, you learn the superior
strategy of fulfilling the needs of the world under pressure, but choosing the thing that will fill
the vacuum strategically, before you tacitly create the vacuum and think your job’s complete;
only to have to come back to the issue once you’ve admitted your first attempt at fixing it was
actually a failure and hopefully this time doing the thing that is strategically correct and choosing
the thing you want instead of just excising the thing you know you don’t want.
In all matters where time to think exists, see the system around the thing, choose what you
want, be strategic, not merely tactical, and you can solve a problem the first time. So this is very
important, when someone doesn’t completely agree with you off the bat and has doubts, you
need to know about that because you didn’t do a good enough job, and you need to test that on
other people to see their reactions the same. Let’s handle the objections before they occur outside
the book!

Sensitivity
Empathy
Empathy is often the privilege of the powerless. “Patience is a minor form of
despair disguised as a virtue.” - Ambrose Bierce. The rage you feel when things aren’t
doing what you want them to do is useful for humans, and animals, it’s not useful for
machines, not at all. And it hurts you.

```
Your Internal Environment
Pain and pleasure programming
Ever wonder why your balls are barely noticeable, until you hit them, and then the
world has changed for the worse? It’s because if your balls get taken out, you’re out of
the gene pool. So the amount of pain we feel is often related to how useful a thing is
for our procreation, more than our survival. It’s the survival of our unborn.
```

Fighting

```
```
I actually really want to put that in environment. And the reason that I want to put
internal environment, by the way, this I got from my martial arts instructor. It’s funny that I
do remember the origin of a lot of the ideas that I’ve gotten. Maybe it’s because I’ve got so
few from some places, so they’re really unique when I get them. So I went to the Warrior
and Scholar Kenpo Karate School, and you know they would say some cool and smart stuff
like you know, “The dragon needs to, the tiger needs to constantly prove itself, so it’s always
fighting and testing itself. But the dragon already knows that it would have won, so it
doesn’t need to fight.” That was a cool saying. There’s shit that you can take away from that,
it’s quiet useful. You can avoid a lot of conflict by assuming the win and you know,
whenever there’s conflict, even when you win, your fucking hands are going to hurt, a lot
```

and your clothes are going to get screwed up, might be some police, might be some lawyers’
fees. The fights you win, you don’t really win. You still lose. You win more of the fight that
you win, you lose less the fight you win, but you still lose. And if you don’t believe that, get
in ten fights in a row and then see how you feel. Believe me, you’ll feel beat up because
you’ll be beat up. Or you’re in one of those experiments with you rather fight forty horse
sized ducks, or one duck sized horse. Or the other way around.

Tit for tat, good for people, bad for machines
The rage you feel when things aren’t doing what you want them to do is useful for
humans, and animals, but it’s not useful for machines, not at all. And it hurts you.
```
```
Let’s say that you default and execute a good tit for tat strategy, and someone
makes you wait, or doesn’t do what they said they would do, now you feel that you
have to punish that behavior. Yep, here’s the bad part. You start executing the
punishment, and are experiencing a negative personal state yourself long before the
punished is ever there to notice at all. And thus you have destroyed your own state of
mind, and your own well-being, in order to execute a useful tit for tat revenge
strategy, and in the end all you have done is hurt yourself.
```
```
Let’s say the person you are interacting with is a real piece of trash, the kind of
piece of trash that shuts down the moment you try to show them the error of their
ways. Now in the end all you have done is negatively alter your emotions and your
quality of life for that tit for tat strategy that doesn’t even work in this case, because
as already stated, they are a piece of trash; they feel no remorse, they have no
empathy, and they’re not interested enough in being excellent to care about your
relationship, so they’ll just fail out as soon as you raise your expectations and move on
to their next victim.
```

The low hanging fruit is to learn to not treat machines like people, for they truly
genuinely don’t’ dedicate a single thought regarding your rage, and will not modify
their behavior to avoid it. They are not conscious actors, and thank goodness, because
if they were judgmental, imagine how they’d treat you based on your internet search
history.
Soul
Soul in and only in the brain
How can damage to the brain be consistent in its effect by location of injury,
yet in death, if you kill it all, somehow, you’re cool, and you just transport to an
afterlife?
After sleep, like an afterlife
You’re obviously too important to not be alive and active and conscious
when you’re sleeping, so every night when you go to sleep, there’s another you
that appears in heaven, and every time you doze off, another copy of you gets
issued. Just as there’s no afterworld for your sleeping self, there is no afterworld
for your dead self. There is only one you, and it’s here, or nowhere.
Soul shit
If everything that makes you what you think you are, your behaviors, your
feelings, your thoughts, your abilities, can be edited by Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation, or lobotomy, how likely is it that you will survive the complete
destruction of your brain? It’s funny that we think that we have bodies, when in
reality, we are bodies.

```
Your soul
Is the likelihood that you perform a certain set of behaviors? If what you are
likely to do changes, your identity, and thus your vary should change. For what
is a person except thoughts and actions? Your identity and “soul” is nothing
more than the likelihood that you think and act in certain ways in the present
and future.
```

```
Well that’s interesting, what about the permanence? What about that
everlasting, undying “thing” which isn’t “meat” and isn’t “your mind, or body?”
That other third thing? Well, that is a fancy fantasy that makes you feel special,
and allows you to do better in the world. Those people that think they don’t
have a soul, they have a harder time of it. It can be harder for them to find
happiness, and harder for them to find meaning, because there’s this gap in
understanding.

Winning can feel like losing
The curse of winning an auction

You won, yay! But now no one will pay more than you did,
because they would have, if they had wanted to. So you basically
just made sure that in the short term, barring an auction house that
has bad marketing for bidders, you overpaid. Due to the ratcheting
effect, the constant pressure of us to get bored, and want more,
this means that you’ve gotten your raise, you can’t get another
raise, because you’ve maxed them out, so by winning, you feel loss.
Power of Groups
Xx (replace religions with groups, let them make the analogy on their own)
**Religion as a costly signal** [edit]
_Further information: Evolutionary psychology of religion_


Religious rituals such assnake handling may be explainable as costly signals.
Costly religious rituals such as male circumcision, food and water
deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms.
Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore
appear maladaptive.[80] Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain
intragroup cooperation.[81] Cooperation leads to altruistic behavior,[82] and
costly signaling could explain this.[19] All religions may involve costly and
elaborate rituals, often performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the
religious group.[83] In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the
group by signaling their investment in group interests. However, as group size
increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows.[52] Costly signaling
theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly
enough to deter free riders.[84]
Irons proposed that costly signaling theory could explain costly religious
behavior. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust and
solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits. He
showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of
northern Iran helped to secure trade agreements. These “ostentatious”
displays signaled commitment to Islam to strangers and group
members.[85] Sosis demonstrated that people in religious communities are
four times more likely to live longer than their secular counterparts,[53][82] and
that these longer lifespans were positively correlated with the number of
costly requirements demanded from religious community
members.[86] However, confounding variables may not have been
excluded.[87] Iannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious
communities. In a self-reported survey, as the strictness of a church
increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased
proportionally. In effect, people were more willing to participate in a church
that has more stringent demands on its members.[88]
Despite the experimental support for this hypothesis, it remains
controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as
simply by attending a religious service.[89] However, the hypothesis predicts
that people are more likely to join and contribute to a religious group when
its rituals are costly.[88] Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There
is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of
commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits.[82] However, the
reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and
punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for
increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for
increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation.[82] However, Sosis

argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved
health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being.[9

Appreciation
We live in magical times
Imagine a time in the not so distant past where there was no GPS navigation,
no cell phones, no beepers, and no internet. Let’s imagine humans were without
television or radio. When you went to a place, that place was all you saw. There
was no easy window to other realities. It was you, your surrounds and your
imagination. Maybe you had the stories told by those around you, maybe you
had your imagination. That’s it. What a magical and different world we have
today. The ability to fly to a faraway land for the price of a night in a hotel. We
truly live in magical times.
The Anology for Sucking it up for the time being Before you do the fun Stuff

218. Nearly all of the great comedians and productive people that you find in the
world weren’t born with silver spoons in their mouths. Some of which even had
crappy jobs that were dead ends, i.e. dock worker, crappy retail, no room for
advancement style jobs. Most of them fought and saved and studied their way into
greatness, which means that you will need to fight and study your way into greatness
by saving and building an intellect that has the traits that other people care about and
are willing to pay for. Now, an easy way to analogize that is that as human beings, we
all have to receive our nutrients through breastfeeding before we’re old enough to
chew. And nobody likes it, and nobody brags about it later in life, but at some point,
we were all attached to our mothers, literally, for survival.

Programmed for laziness & Internal Conflict/Lobbying

383. So, we’re talking about personal development and lobbying for what you
want in the world, and then the internal lobbying you do with yourself by creating
things that you’ll actually do instead of the imaginary, “These are all the things that I
would do if I had the balls to actually do everything that I planned.” You could call it
infinite discipline perhaps. It would require infinite time but maybe you’re not that
creative; maybe everything you’d ever want to do personally doesn’t take that much
time because you have a small standard for what must exist in your life.
So, there’s a set of things that you would tell yourself to do if you had infinite
willpower to do everything, right? Do a set of max bench-press. You know what? We’ll
just do a set of max on every muscle every other day and then we’ll split it and maybe
split it in three push- and pull-ups whatever. And, we’ll only eat food that’s flavorless
but has maximum health benefits; omega 3s, proteins and very little refined sugars,
very little refined anything. Then we’ll get the proper perfect dose of vitamin D. We’ll
get on down the list, doing all the perfect things. “I’ll call my mom this many times a
year. I’ll volunteer this many times a year,” etc., etc.
At some point you discover you’re not doing most of this, right? Why? Because
laziness exists. You’re programmed for laziness. Laziness has paid off great dividends
by using less calories for hundreds of thousands of years and so you’re going to
engage in laziness, right? So, what do we do? We start knocking things off that set
that you want to do but you know you’re not actually going to do.
Then, you get to level three which is, which of the things can you keep doing over
time? So, you went to the gym twice and then you stopped, who cares? Oh, you went
and learned 10 new words of a new language and then you stopped, again, no one
gives a shit.
And then, there are things that are even worse; there are things you can learn a
little bit about and you think that you actually know what you’re talking about but you
have no clue. Maybe it is drug use, maybe it is shooting firearms without enough
safety, maybe it’s driving like a race car driver; you think you’re good at it but now
you’re dead and wrapped around a pole or worse, you’ve injured someone else’s
family because you think you’re as good a driver as Lewis Hamilton.


```
So, what lesson is to be learned here? Scivive is telling you that there’s an internal
conflict inside our self which is: the set of things you would do ideally; the set of things
you’ll actually do; then the smaller sub set of things that you’ll actually do over a long
enough period of time to get the benefits you want. Then we have another smaller set
called the things you convinced other people to do and then that set gets run through
the same shit that yours just did. All you did was add to their big list and then it gets to
their smaller list and then it gets to their smaller sub-lists. And so, the actual amount
of shit you can convince people to do for a long enough period of time in their own
life to improve their life is super small and probably an order of magnitude smaller
than what you can do for yourself. So, force your brain to get something into your
own psychology and program it, and do it long enough for it to become a lasting habit.

The hard life of doing the right thing
It’s pretty emotionally shocking when your good reasoning keeps making you need
to be a hard-ass and not do things you enjoy. It’s a good thing we learn to love what
we’re good at, and the respect that comes with it.
Cooperating with yourself to get shit done is the smallest version of collectivism
40.
Collectivism works great and the smallest unit of collectivism isn’t a pair of people
working together like friends, it’s actually getting yourself to do work that you should
do. Because this internal struggle between what you should do what you can do and
what you actually do is a form of cooperation internal to yourself, so there should be a
special (0.5) half a human extra unit of cooperation that can occur internally.
You, while making decisions, are not equal to one, you’re equal to at least one and
a half.

Tony Robbins is the most successful success coach in the world
Tony Robbins is the most successful success coach in the world. He
could be creating copies of himself. He could have a curriculum in schools.
He could be giving away his seminars for free instead of giving away food
for free. He could be having a lasting and meaning impact on the world in
the same scale that capitalism, Marxism, communism, religion,
libertarianism, republicanism, socialism, being a democrat, etc. However,
he is not. Why doesn’t he have much YouTube following? Why doesn’t he
have a podcast? Why doesn’t he have a radio show? Why doesn’t he have
better quotes? Why hasn’t his material improved in 15 years?
Well, one could be guessing, but maybe Robbins doesn’t want to risk
the money. Perhaps he’s run out of steam. He was a better organizer and
presenter of others’ ideas but ran out of steam when he stopped
absorbing from others. His height has left him starved for oxygen over
time, and it’s affected his creative thinking, he is exceptionally tall,
standing at six feet seven inches.
Sex, money, power or perhaps happiness?
If you interview old people or middle-aged people about what advice they have for
you when you’re younger, the number of older men that will tell you to have as much

you wonder what really is important in life.

Careers giving people what they desire is horrible
Imagine the only thing in this world is you and your house. You could either paint
your house today, or you could build a chair. If you choose to paint your house, it will
end up painted. If you choose to build a chair, you will end up with a chair. That’s it
folks, that’s the entire magic of careers. You will cause in the world what you choose
to cause. This is where we are with most of the young smart folks of the world
working on the next best rate-my-sandwich application. People work for money,
money is exchanged for what people want, and what people want usually is often
ridiculous. Thus, what people do with their time is also ridiculous, as an effect of the
first cause of humans having really stupid desires. If you are giving people what they
want, you’re very likely to be harming them, because what people want is quite often
not what they should want.

common theme. Think about the hours they put in. How many hours they spent
unrewarded, being made fun of, or broke and living in a van?
Feel the win now
Feel the future, get some easy wins. Like speed wins.
One trick you can use to shift the reward of what you are doing close
enough to the present for you to enjoy doing it, and feel rewarded
working on it, is to see how fast you can do it. And if it’s something
repetitive, you can see if you can beat your old time. This likely will restrict
your creativity. This can be a good thing if what you are doing is repetitive
enough, and let’s be serious, much of what we need to do in life, we’re
putting zero minutes into.
Feel the future. If you’re doing something great that leads in a great
direction, dream a little in that direction. Take some of that future joy and
bring it back into the present with yourself. Knowing the true value and
joy at the end of the path will make you want to travel truer and faster
down that path.
The first minute of progress is the most important, for it is that minute
that makes all the minutes that come after it possible. An object in motion
tends to stay in motion. Get that first minute! So any subsequent minutes
of nearly any quality will be more likely to get you into the hobby and
then enjoy it, and then gaining a habit of doing what you need to be
doing.
Freedom to fail
More success begets more freedom. More freedom allows for more mistakes. You
have no boss, and your old state that allowed success is not similar to the new
successful state. You might start to believe your own bullshit.
Permission to screw up
A life of success is a life of failure. The more opportunities to do good you have,
and try and experiment with, the more you will mess up. The only person who makes
no mistakes is a dead person.

Don’t make problems, you don’t need


This is taken from an interview with, Quentin Tarantino, and he said he got it from
Harvey Keitel (was an interview with Ridley Scott, and Quentin and lots of other
amazing directors on The Hollywood insider) Like a good director, don’t ruin
someone’s performance acting out a part for you that they have had to think about
and work on, see what they have to show you, and redirect them as you wish. Scivive
feels the same way about directing people’s decisions in regards to their choice of
career and education.
It’s great to see where they are at, and try to figure out their motivation and needs
that they are trying to meet with their decision. You’ll find that you agree with several
bad ass paths, and that arriving to agreement on their choosing of one of those
several paths would be great, regardless of the specific need or reason that gets them
to choose that good behavior. Look at it like this, if you talk with someone, and find
that together you discover that they should have healthy eating as part of their life,
they could internally have lots of different ways they supported that decision, for
some it may be guilt, others greed, others vanity, others a search for balance, some
want to be stronger, some want to free, better.
Offer them paths that meet their needs, and you feel are awesome. You don’t
have to have the same reason why you think it’s awesome, it only matters that they
do the thing; they don’t have to have the same ends only the same means.
You should choose your own name, and you should have your own logo, and you
should have your own slogan, and you should have your own unique benefit
statement, if not multiple statements that are relevant to the multiple parties to
which your value is differently measured. It’s very like that the things your lovers care
about are quite different from the things that your employers or employees or
customers will care about, unless perhaps you’re quite promiscuous and in the sex for
hire business, perhaps then a more common statement would fit in all those places.
For the non sex-workers among us, we’re very likely to need a few varying great
qualities to do the job optimally.
Why would I suggest that you do these rare, and rather crazy things? Well, for the
same reason that one might suggest to any business that they do the same. In a world
of limited resources, even the consideration and respect of others is a scarce
resource, and if you to leave the least to chance, and ensure your success in the time


you have here, you might as well do all the things that work. Led Zeppelin and Prince
had logos that represented them.

Businesses will spend millions upon millions of dollars changing a well-known
name they’ve had for years in the very often belief that a more unique name will get
them higher in the consciousness of their customers and users and therefore is worth
the short term cost of changing to use a different a better name. Musicians and actors
also often take advantage of the ability to choose not only ones clothing but name to
be more exotic and unique, and whereas you have probably not heard of Thomas
Mapother, but you have heard of Tom Cruise; they’re the same person. Ringo Star,
Cher, Prince, Jamie Foxx, and so on, many people have taken advantage of choosing
what their own name should be to meet their own desires in life, instead of using the
rather optimized for someone else’s goals name that you were assigned before you
were old enough to have any say in it. I would say that last names are even worse
because it’s more common to have a good and common first name and a foreign
sounding, unpronounceable, or crappy last name. It’s hard for someone to ruin a first
name for you, and pretty easy to ruin a last name. You won’t’ find many Hitlers but
you can still find quite many Adolphs. So if you have the courage to optimize your first
name, do find the courage to optimize your last as well. You may have come into the
good fortune that your last name is associated with greatness, perhaps you are a Von-
something or another, or you are a Kennedy, or a Bush, etc., if so, lucky you. Most of
us are not.

You have to know when some friends are telling you they think you have some
kind of mental problem, particularly the same mental problem they have tried to
convince themselves that they have. They might not be trying to harm you, they might
only be trying to get you the same profit that they found in the belief of the strange
mental trait. For instance, some people want to think they are psychos, but they
actually aren’t. They like the idea, and they want you to be as they are and profit in
the screwed up belief as they think they do. So sometimes hurtful words in their mind
are supposed to be helpful.


Don’t believe your own bullshit - Spirit
Don’t believe your own bullshit. Perhaps you once did something great, and you
hope to do something great again, but this time you’re not doing to do the thing the
same way. This time you believe your own hype, and don’t use the same tools and
reference to excellence that you hit the first time. This time around you may have
more of you in the project, and yet you are likely to make a shit thing, because what
makes something great is rarely the product of a single person’s new ideas, and
commonly the product of a single persons mixing and melding and building on the
greatest ideas they know, and by definition those greatest ideas are not their own. If
everything you are doing is new, it is probably bad. Or maybe you don’t know that it’s
actually been done before, and you wrongly believe yourself to be the source. You
must have objective reasons why something is measurably good or better, outside
your own opinion. Your own opinion rarely discovers anything new, and often makes
only judgments upon others creation. Creation is harder than absorption and rating.
It’s much easier to watch a film than to create a film.

If people call you arrogant, and they only ever hear the good things you say about
yourself, how could they feel any different? If they weren’t there when you were
overhyping yourself, they have a poor sample size to estimate whether you have a
healthy opinion of yourself that mirrors reality.
```
```
If you are good at something and don’t reward yourself by being accurate
regarding your greatness at the thing, you aren’t really helping yourself, you’re just
helping the shit-talkers of the world that wish you harm, and wish they were better
than you. Now that is to say, you need to be accurate, and hopefully are referencing
objecting measurement that is non-biased, to qualify yourself for bragging or pride.
Many fools claim greatness with only their own super biased opinion for evidence.

If you were born into this world, lucky enough to be male, and strong, and able to

a powerful person, you are probably a piece of shit. Screw you.

don’t want to actually get to know you, they just want the photo. This is like the

world? You’d produce less, you’d take less risk, and you might only hurt them less by
reminding them how they suck during the few moments you are with those who are
hateful. You should optimize for the environment you are more commonly in because
it pays better dividends. Haters are always going to hate.

The World
**Evolutionary Psychology**
SC1.80 Our design
So someone’s got to break that mold. Someone’s got to say, “Yeah.
What are you going to do with your life? I’m going to be a rapper.” Be a
rapper, maybe baller, go play in the NBA and hook up with chicks all day long.
It’s going to be amazing.” Well, it’s not great that the young people of the
world only have that as a role model, and nothing else. That’s it. That’s your
idolatry, ballers and movie stars and bikini models. We are designed to be
powerful, important, sexually wanted. That is what we crave - if you don’t care
about those things, you don’t have kids in the game anymore. Right?
Evolutionary Biology
SC1.3- Pair bonding and our old hardware
In addition, we are dying because our hard wiring is bad. Our relationships
and pair bonding relationships, when we have only one partner, are being
destroyed. Though now we have contraception and DNA tests, the same risks
that used to happen because someone “cheated on you” have remained; as for
your offspring, in this case it turns out that your genes have nothing to do with
the next generation because you got tricked into thinking that you already had a
kid, but you did not, as your woman conceived outside the relationship. So you


got duped and eliminated and your bloodline failed to pass on unless you
started cheating too. That’s funny, isn’t it?
Supernormal Stimuli
SC1.7- Scivival & Supernormal Stimuli-
There needs to exist a good name or good belief in science, which will save
our own asses and that of our beloved ones and offspring, and that of our
species as a whole. What could that be called? It should include a component of
survival, but survivalists spoil everything. They are programmed for doing the
wrong things. They collect bullets and guns, but they vanish once the shit hits
the fan. It’s fun and enjoyable to collect such things and dream of the need for
them, and that’s why zombie apocalyptic movies are so popular. Furthermore,
guys love all these apocalypse movies maybe because then they and their
personalities actually matter, their life matters, but their daily life is nothing.
The things some do in their daily lives are too insignificant. Oh, you have
checked your Facebook, congrats! Oh, you have played a game and got some
new achievements? Impressive. These are our super normal stimuli as they are
called now; it is they that lock us in this horrible reality.
SC1.79 We Are adapted for scarcity
So if you have that belief in anti-scarcity - which by the way is the opposite
belief that people have, then good for you. Human beings are trained, just like
road rage, just like pair bonding, caring so much about significance; all that shit
that’s built into us; were built to care about scarcity.

So, many people like to collect and hoard things that nobody else has, right?
We find something that is unique or rare and feel an urge to obtain it for
ourselves. And so we find it hard to understand the way the world really
prospers, with abundance instead of scarcity, exponential growth instead of
linear. These are things that are very hard for us to understand.
Progressively less well adapted


49. You’re going to get progressively more and more mal adapted for the world
that you live in because the rate at which society and technology are changing is vastly
exceeding the rate at which we are adapting genetically.
SC1.1- Tribal Psychology
Human beings have evolved to the maximum for the world that no longer exists;
everything we feel today worked very well when we were travelling around in groups
of 50. When someone cuts you off on the road or someone steps on your foot and
screws up your shoes, you get very angry. Do you know there were gangland
shootings in the 1990s? Perhaps you heard about the so called “knockout game,”
when you attempt to randomly knock people out with a single punch as they go about
their daily lives, it was a disgusting thing that passed through the United States. Acts
of barbarism such as those ones are well founded in the tribal psychology, and they
serve their purpose.
SC1.40- Need for Social Importance & Approach Anxiety
So here’s what happens in every conversation. In every conversation, the
participants want to look important. It matters. If you travel around a group of 50
people and you’re not important, and there’s limited food, well, you might not eat,
sorry. “There is not much food, and we don’t like you that much.” So you’re going to
eat last, or not at all. Or maybe we’ll just kill you because you look stupid. That was
the old order of things. That’s why when you trip, you act like you are actually about
to start jogging. Because you don’t want to look weak, because you’ll be taken
advantage of. That’s why approach anxiety exists; you don’t want to walk up to a
random girl and compliment her because if that random girl just happens to be
related to or is hooking up with the tribal leader you’ll get rocked in the head with a
real rock, or killed in your sleep.
What you feel is largely what helped us survive
All of the things which we feel are beautiful, for the most part, are also there
because they helped us survive. It turns out that in the old days, survival was really
difficult. So for example we now love to look out at the open ocean and feel the
breeze. This is engrained in us because fish live in the ocean, and they’re tasty, and
people from faraway lands that we want to trade with often land from the water, so
living near water is great because it provides us food and opportunity.


The source of Morals
Lots of things that can help us understand and succeed in life can be learned from
the animal kingdom. Followers of the faith like to say that we get morality from
religion, which is pretty funny. Let’s see, are animals moral? Yes they are; they all
follow a moral code. They work in teams and follow social norms, and develop
adaptive behavior that must be adhered to in the herd. This shows that morality being
an invention of religion is such an insanely stupid idea. How about people that have
become non-religious from a position where they once were, did they increase in
criminality? Not likely.

If it’s true that the quality of your life is the average of the quality of emotion you
have and some things are wildly addicting, particularly things that have intermittent
reward like gambling, sports, and competition. You may enjoy going to bars and trying
to be intimate with a member of the opposite sex, even if you don’t plan to go all the
way to the ultimate consummation of two people’s attraction for each other. (I.e.
mating for life and having offspring) Well, if you get good at these things, such as
playing poker or being intimate with people in bars, and the reward is intermittent, it
will addict you.
Now, what’s the problem with being addicted to intermittingly rewarding highly
emotionally involved and charged risk taking behavior and feeling super important
because either you won or you made love? What could be more validating to your
value and worth as a human being than someone else wanting to share their body,
the most sacred thing they have with you, alone and hidden from the rest of the
world? Well, now you’ve got a problem; for lots of guys they go out and they find that
attraction, they have that experience, they have that fun and then they get too old
and they stop. Perhaps it becomes too easy and they get too bored and they stop; or
it becomes too difficult and the interment reward doesn’t happen enough so they get
bored and frustrated. So, what’s the worst outcome that could actually happen? That
you stayed just the right amount of challenged and have just the right amount of fun
that now it’s an addiction that doesn’t get replaced, it doesn’t get changed. And so,
you don’t grow as a person; you don’t make business friends because you’re hung-

over from what you did last night. You don’t have children because you’re good at
contraception and you know how to use condoms and that part of your life gets

sexes respect by having success in an area outside of the nightclub.

The mythical value of ancient things
As human beings we spent much of our formative years without written language
and therefore much if not all of the learning that we got from our elders cam in the
form of stories. The keeping of history and the transference of knowledge has existed
in the spoken form longer than any other form we know of. The usefulness of a story
told is in great relation to the ability to remember the story or learn from it; and as
humans we’ve also developed a keen ability to remember things that we think are
important at the cost of forgetting things that aren’t so important. If you take a look at
the “power” section of this book, particularly the mnemonics section you’ll find that if
you imagine things vividly with colors and textures and exaggerated size, use motion
and sexuality or humor, your brain will find them more important, and therefore you’ll
be more likely to remember them.

marker for us to know what is important to focus on. Things that are mysterious are
able to maximally satisfy our curiosity, because by definition curiosity can only be
satisfied by the unknown. This is where we find a hiccup in the otherwise good
programming. Things that are ancient are inherently unknown, because of bad record
keeping, bad communication so that even if good records were kept you might not
ever be delivered the information regarding an event because everyone that was
there from your team died. Say, a battle, or a natural disaster killed all the potential
message deliverers. There’s also almost always a language barrier, because if the
```

event, or thing, or place which you are feeling mysterious vibes from was over 1500
years ago, The English language didn’t’ exist yet.

When you combine bad communication with bad recording keeping, and do it in a
language not even spoken today, you’ve got quite a few good ingredients for
triggering the feeling of mystery. Thus, because we are driven by curiosity, and
because the ancient past due to its obscurity and often unknowable nature, many of
us find ancient things fascinating.

Sadly, sometimes there’s things you’d be better off being curious about that are
actually useful, instead of those not useful. The longer we exist on this planet creating
more and more history, fiction, and culture, the larger the set of rather non useful
interests grows, and the smaller the set becomes of really useful interesting things
becomes in comparison. The reality is that the ancient past was much more difficult in
terms of daily life. It’s not very easy to derive value from what those backwards and
ancient cultures did. If you knew the amount of human sacrifice that was performed,
you’d be shocked. It’s pretty obvious that human sacrifice doesn’t get the gods’ favor,
or perhaps you would see those cultures still in existence, through their harnessing of
such power. Fiction is fun, mystery is fun, however often not so useful.
Look at it this way, if the past was useful, and perhaps better than today,
especially technologically, how would we go about forgetting about those discoveries
and not having them available in the present time? When in the future do you think
that the world will forget how to make the cheese burger? We just haven’t had giant
wiping out of knowledge often enough during the periods where history was
considered valuable enough to keep track of to lose chunks of valuable information.
And thus what you end up with is the fallacy of proof by complexity, for the apparent
intelligence and complex nature of a civilization or person lost to ancient history, due
to the fact they weren’t effective enough to keep their own records or culture intact
into modern times. If they were effective enough to be awesome, they’d have been
able to keep good enough records to be not mysterious. They would be like the
Greeks and Romans, awesome and respected, however, without much mystery.


```
If the Egyptians were more awesome and effective, we would know as much
about them as we do the Greeks and Romans, and then they too would be as
respected, however, because they were less effective and had less of an impact on the
world, we now see them as mysterious. Don’t be confused. To be unique isn’t
necessarily useful and to be mysterious doesn’t mean that you have much to learn
from nor that you should be respected. Don’t fall for the appeal to complexity logical
fallacy. Anything that was good enough to kick ass 1000 years ago has been rarely
forgotten, and is now known and respected and thus non mysterious. Most mysteries
are actually quite uninteresting once you are well educated enough to see them for
what they are. You could say much of these same things about numerous ancient and
surviving religions as well. The set of forgotten and rediscovered things is nearly
infinitely smaller than the set of things remembered.
Your feelings are optimized for a world that no longer exists.
You face so much less mortal danger today than we ever have in the past, your
emotionally excellent system for the wilderness doesn’t work so well in the Wal-Mart.
You’re more likely to have a heart attack from overreacting or overeating than you are
to be eaten by a predator.
Don’t waste your time focusing on the useless mysteries when you have plenty of
useful mysteries so near. Don’t be triggered into interest by complexity, particularly
the complexity of fiction. Instead find the myth and mystery of the real world, which is
quite complicated and magical enough on its own.
```
ancient stuff sucks, that’s why its lost and ancient.. who cares... Most antiques suck

710 - Collecting, not using - Spirit
It’s interesting that fetishism that human beings have, we focus on cars and
collecting them but not driving them. We’ll focus on cameras and collecting them but


```
not taking better photos. Humorously, the same goes for gym equipment. So it seems
rather odd that we focus on the things rather than the activity surrounding the things.
If we focused on the activity surrounding the things that the things were useful for,
then there would be more training, more excellence, and more usage, instead of
hoarding.
```
```
Nature of reality
Remember when there were words you didn’t know, and had to look them up?
The books that had them, used to be confusing to you, and now you love those words
and you may love those books. What changed? Your resolution, your resolving power,
you’re ability to discern difference and quality is what has altered your likeness to
them.
```
```
Don’t take advice on the sharpness of an image or lenses from another man,
unless you know that man actually has a good eye, great eyes, and superhuman eyes.
So if one is able to see things better than yourself, and detect details that that you
could not, only then should you trust their opinions on what something actually looks
like.
```
```
Imagine that you are the cells that divided, over and over again, to organize from a
single cell in our mother’s womb into the person whose eyes are absorbing the light of
this text right now. You might even hear a strong, deep voice in your mind, speaking in
a wise tone the words on the pages of this work.
```
By that same token, know thyself, perhaps you are the one that is myopic and
outclassed. Let objective tests rule the day and decide who has the ability to even
know the difference between better and worse, because they can at least see a
difference to be able to choose one or the other based on something other than
random chance.
Model of the world
Be free by giving away your freedom
Follow the law


This is what following the law does for you. You submit yourself to the will of
your fellow man, and in return, he will protect your property and your
investments, and enforce your contracts for you. Your fellow man and the
society you live in sets the limits to what you can achieve. If you live in a lawless
land, you can’t get too much done in this world.
Anonymity on the internet is nearly impossible
If you clear your cookies, they hide tracking in your flash player. If you clear
your flash player with a special tool, they track what fonts you have installed
and what browser you’re using. If you install NoScript, don’t load flash, and
somehow magically only allow certain fonts, well now you stand out too. Woe is
the man who desires privacy against a motivated attacker. How few apps that
you want on your phone would work if you said no to all the bullshit
permissions they asked for? Sadly, in this day and age, it’s easier to choose to be
a sheep then eat 20 percent of your useful life trying to be “free.” One day when
the crypto community has more progress under their belt, you can readdress
the issue with better tools. Right now it takes too much time for too little gain to
maintain privacy.
The utility value of believing things that aren’t true.
You want to believe in something greater than you because, doing so makes you
more effective, and if you saw that truly the thing above you that was greater than
you was the false belief that there was really a thing, and that it wasn’t just a way to
be more effective by believing in a thing that may or may not be true, then it would
work less well.
There are all kinds of places in life where inaccurate and unfounded beliefs lead to
greatness, as anyone that has practiced “fake it till you make it” discovers. So, sadly
it’s probably much easier to let people believe that there is truly something greater
than themselves that drives them, then it is to eat the midterm loss of performance of
the shock that it’s an illusion, albeit an effective illusion.
Anthropomorphizing emotions
People assign human emotions to gods and we kind of assign emotions to “the
system” (that wants things from us) but there is however a system that’s not
anthropomorphized. It doesn’t want anything from you. We just have evolved to treat


things as though they were human, because it’s more affective that way, because
most of the problems we have growing up were more “human” than “lion” and that’s
why we have speech and track eye cues. Shifty eyes, for example, gives you clues on a
person’s intent. Enough people had to get killed from shifty eyed criminals for it to
mean something that is commonly accepted as a cue. So part of the reason to
measure a gods desires or emotions is funny because if there is a god he surely
doesn’t have the same emotions as you do....UNLESS that god system is actually part
of an evolving set of other gods that he has to compete with and mate with and have
limited resources. Maybe human beings are the food it uses to support itself in the
god culture.

302.So watching a movie is a lie. The people in it aren’t the people that really did
the thing, the time that it happened wasn’t the time it really happened, the rain is
usually fake, the lighting is usually fake, and it’s all fake, right? But it’s awesome, and
similarly, believing religion is the same way. It’s an easy way to have an enjoyable, fun,
fulfilling experience in life, unfortunately at the cost of truth and, depending on which
religion you’re following and to what degree, could be a lot of violence and killing in
there which are some negative side effects.

251.Belief in God makes you take a narrative that you think like, “Hey this video
game is horrible and going out sucks, so if God made the world this way then he must
have done all that just so I could write this book because there’s nothing else fun to
do.” Some think that there’s this interesting theory that if you’re motivated and you
believe in God, depending on what type of belief you have around what God
supposedly did, it may greatly affect your behavior. Now, one could guess this isn’t
that interesting because it’s all totally up to how you use your brain. There’s lots of
other people that think the absolute wrong thing and they do worse for it. But, there’s
some inkling of learning here, in that by believing in something, it changes what you
do.


261.Wou’re promised something so huge (life eternal ever after) and the payment
that you have to make for that huge payoff in the future, the small fee that you need
to pay in advance, to get that amazing thing is to love God and do a few things that
you were doing anyway. You know, don’t covet thy neighbor’s wife. You weren’t doing
that because your neighbor would kick your face in or stab you or whatever they did
back then. Another example prohibits murder. Yeah, most of us weren’t doing that
anyway. So you’re telling people that they can get all this super cool shit without
really changing their behavior at all and just, changing who they say they love?

If you say you love your wife, and she wants to talk to you for an hour after work
about the dumb shit that happened that day and about gossip that you don’t
understand or care about, you still have to listen and love it and enjoy it because you
aspire to be a good husband. Your wife needs to feel important and you need to listen
to what’s important to her. When you’re talking about writing a book or shit she
doesn’t care about, you expect her to be a good wife and listen to what you are
passionate about even if she’s not invested in your idea. Well, if you want eternal
everlasting life, God is never going to call you to discuss a bad day He had at work and
talk to you for an hour about shit you don’t want to hear. He’ll give you everlasting
life, and all you need to give Him in return is basically nothing. Just do shit that you
would’ve already done anyway and were already doing for the last religion you were
in.

But this one sounds better because maybe they’ve got less requirements. You
know, you can keep slaves. That’s cool. Maybe this other religion doesn’t like you
keeping slaves. Now, by changing your following, that removes the guilt. “I didn’t feel
good about keeping slaves, but now that I’ve switched religions, I not only have less
guilt, but I also get this cooler story, right?” It’s a better evolved story because it’s
been told for a couple thousand years so they figured out some improvements, right?
They’re like, “oh, virgin birth, that worked. Let’s copy that from here.” “Oh, talking fire
tree. That sounds awesome.


```
That worked over here. Let’s have the talking fire tree. People will respect that shit.
Sea monster, giant sea monster that swallows people and then spits them back up.
Sounds legit. Sounds totally legit, bro. Floods and shit, let’s run with that.”
I guess you could call that certainty, right?
Anytime that you think that there’s only a limited number of things that goes into
a complicated thing, it’s very likely that you just don’t know all the other things that
are there. You know, if you’ve got literally an itch that you desperately feel that you
must scratch, well, what is that? The scratching and itch. Certainty? Is it variety? No,
it’s just another response to a multivariate, which is a fancy word for many variable
inputs that human beings have. Now that is to say there’s a lot of very cool decisions
and learning and things that comes out of using the six human needs psychology to
discover things. It’s better than most of the other ones out there.
```
If you look at the variety of human experience, we also have happiness and
sadness. Now are those needs? Do we have a need to feel happy and a need to feel
sad and a need to change our state if you can? Do we need the changing state that
you can call that variety? What about all the other emotions? Revenge, rage, and
guilt. Are those needs? Is guilt a need? Lots of people feel it. It seems to be a quite
useful way to gather the wisdom of the crowds and to personal individual
effectiveness. Yes, obviously it is often perturbed and misused, however one could say
guilt and having a conscience is definitely more good than bad. You know, you could
make another nice analogy to understand the inaccuracy of having only six human
needs of which two are optional, so you really only have four. Then you could just say
it’s to be or not to be. To do same or to do different. Well, you could learn something
from that. But perhaps if you’re a smart dude, you’d be better off with a more in-
depth and nuanced understanding of the human, the most complicated thing we’re
aware of in the universe.
The profitable illusion of a soul
It is funny how so many people want to make the division between mind and body,
even soul and mind, then you put them in an arm bar, apply some pain, and all that
fancy crap disappears. Or take the mentally ill, who are totally lost in soul, personality,
and everything that goes along with it, and you put a little tiny pill of some fancy man


```
made stuff in their tummy, and they’re back, where was their soul when they were
crazy? Where was everything that made them so special?
```
```
It is useful to think very highly of yourself, and to even think you are amazing and
special, because to yourself you are truly the most special thing you will ever
experience. In reality, the things that make us who we are very modifiable based on
the temperature, how much sleep you have had, or whether you have any
mushrooms that make you hallucinate or drugs in your system. Even smart
transhumanists think that we can transcend our mortal coil; they think that we’ll be
able to digitalize our consciousness and live forever. Won’t that be funny when the
4chan hackers are pwning your soul? Remember those same 4chan hackers that are
bored and tired of feeling powerless are going to have access to DNA synthesis and
will likely be able to make very dangerous things in their free time.
```
727 - Deep - Spirit
It’s interesting that human beings appear to have the same chemical composition
in ratio that the rest of the universe has, or at least the rest of the earth. The things
that are more abundant on earth, are more abundant in us and things are less
abundant earth or less abundant in us. Some believe if you want to think you’re
special then you could at least be made of something rare. But instead, humans are
made of the most common stuff that’s around. If it’s really the fact that we evolved
from the most common stuff well then it’s likely that life is a rather a reflection of its
environment and it likely happens on its own, as long as that stuff’s around. And so
one could ask, isn’t it interesting that we have self-emergent life over and over again
from common materials? However, because of relativity, short life spans, and great
distances, we will never meet each other. And so it’s interesting that in a separate
universe that we live in where the only two species that evolved separately from each
other and never got to meet were literally ones that survived the opportunities of self-
destruction and lasted so long, that the two parties could actually meet and reach
each other. Then the question arises if two conscious life forms could meet each other
from great distances and great lengths of time, would they care about meeting each
other? Scivive would argue, yes they would care, for the same reasons that caring


```
evolved here, because it’s an effective strategy. The beings that don’t care stopped
being around and they don’t get to survive for a billion years to meet the other race.
Anything that’s around for a billion years, long enough to get to meet the other race,
does in fact care. Therefore, it would be a very interesting meeting and it’s possible
that it would come with more of a bang than a whimper.
```
Danger and opportunity happen in an instant
Thus, the single man usually beats the committee.
This is why most successful organizations in the world rest upon the decision of a
single man. If you attempted to replace the man with a committee, the decision
making would take much longer, sometimes to the point of making no decisions at all.
Thus for the same reasons that organizations with a single fast decision maker
outperform organizations that take too long to decide things, you as an organism,
outperform slow thinking creatures with a faster, fight or flight, friend or foe
emotional response.
Psychopaths
A chapter called You really should care what other people think. QR

115. One good argument for caring about others being good is the fact that people
who have the least empathy (psychopaths) end up being very not useful for society.

```
It is a common saying that you should not care what other people think. This is
completely and entirely wrong, and you already know it. Before this book destroys
this common saying, Scivive would like to impart that it’s offered so commonly as
wisdom for good reason. Many people care about what the wrong people think. And if
not the wrong people, the wrong timing or angles. Timing and angles, what does that
mean? Well, it turns out that when people judge you or speak about you, they’re
usually doing it because it provides them a profit they are unaware of, and it just feels
good. The reason it just feels good to gossip and judge others is because it raises your
social status among your peers. It gives an easy target to agree upon which leads to
better teamwork and bonding among friends. To create an “us and them” mentality, a
collectivism so to speak, gives the gossipers and judgers a common group for
understanding and behavior that makes them more effective, however at a price. The
```

price is, as soon as they find profit in praise instead of negativity, they have to eat
those words.
Wisdom
Cells divided speaking through Scivivalism
Imagine that you are the cells that divided, over and over again, to organize from a
single cell in our mothers’ womb, into the person whose eyes are absorbing the light
of this text right now. You might even hear a strong, deep voice in your mind,
speaking in a wise tone the words on the pages of this work.
Religion
How create a cult - sales through lies
Religion is interesting. If you wanted people to adopt your new belief system over
their current one, a tactic could be to tell them they’re allowed to do what they really
want to do (take land from others, keep slaves, and subjugate women) and you can
pretend that you’re actually restricting them in some way. They don’t mind at all. They
don’t have the guilt that any normal moral would have regarding the inhuman
treatment of fellow peoples.
It’s like selling someone a TV and saying that it was priced wrong and the salesman
is going to get in trouble if for offering such a low price, it locks the sale in. This is
because buyers see value in getting something they shouldn’t have gotten. Perhaps in
reality that story was made up, and they bring another “special” TV out for sale once
that person leaves the store.

```
Offering people an excuse to believe that they’re paying with effort that you think
is valuable (not working on Sunday), and pretending you’re getting payment from
them for the thing they really want, by faking that they’re paying you for the privilege
of doing what they really want, by doing the thing you say you don’t want them to do,
which they didn’t really ever care about much at all.
So a preacher may say you’re not allowed to work on Sunday like it’s a sacrifice,
and preaches that you earn something with that sacrifice, but low and behold, you
didn’t want to actually work Sunday at all. And now the preacher has not only given
you exactly what you actually wanted, but also gave you pride in that you were being
```

```
paid extra to do the thing that you wanted to do anyway. That selling through lies is
how the preacher can get a belief system to outcompete another one.
You can offer them more benefits with less costs, and followers won’t think that
it’s fake, and that they’re really just taking the easy way out. Because you confuse the
issue with these false payments, and meaningless simple behaviors that you “require
of them” like saying some prayers that take a minute or two, when all you really want
from them is for them to obey what you say that isn’t in the book. To have your food
handed to you by your followers. To have, depending on your cult, their female
children handed to you to do with as you please, as the sole privilege of the leader of
a powerful sect or cult, or religion. Who is more important and secure in a society
than the person that’s responsible for God’s good will towards you? Can you imagine
what would happen if you insulted such a prophet?
```
```
Well one can tell you what happened in the bible, II Kings 2:23-24, where some
children made fun of God’s profit Elisha, and God seeing this sent a pack of female
mountain lions or bears to kill and feast on the children, who if I remember correctly
numbered
13.

Calculate what God is
If you want to know whether there’s a God, you can look at the way natural things
are made and just calculate what God would look like from that. But people, for
whatever reason, back then didn’t really think it was a great idea, and maybe it’s not a
great idea now, because you’re kind of anthropomorphizing reality in ways that don’t
work for things that aren’t human. Only humans are human; Things that are not
human probably do not behave as humans. If you stub your toe in your chair, your

McDonalds has more effect than Christianity
The McDonalds franchise is very likely to affect more human behavior on a daily
basis than Christianity and most other religions. It has more employees that wear
uniforms, show up to work, move around more, do more commerce, and serve more
customers than the local churches. Thus while it is fun to talk about which religions
are the most crazy, it would probably be more useful for humans to start new and
productive business enterprises which truly control the productive hours and
behaviors of this world, at least until a time comes when religions might control man
more than businesses. For then we’re surely lost.

Free will
Sometimes you’ll hear very intelligent people say that they imagined a creator when
trying to discover truths about the universe. And they very well probably did, and they may
have gotten the same result thinking that the creator was a bored child with a computer in
another universe, than some superhuman-like being. Or perhaps their intellect is forever
colored by the ideas that hit it first, for the same reason that it is colored by the language
that hit it first. The order of operations matter. Scivive would not make the statement that
adopting such coloring is how the world works best. In the end, if you’re trying to think
smarter, to some degree, it doesn’t matter that much, because on a long enough time scale,
the machines will out think us all,

Please don’t try to outsmart the machines, it only works if you’re doing a type of
thinking they can’t yet do. And you need the results of that thinking before they figure out
how to do it on their own. It’s also pretty damn misleading to refer to the machines as
though they are evolved conscious actors that exist because they care to, they’re likely
going to be the agents of humans for quite a while, because we’re the result of a couple
billions years of life being rewarded for caring if it existed or not. If you just got to the life
party, you might be the drunk guy whose last words were, “look here at how I can juggle
these chain saws!” Maybe putting in a strong desire to survive at all costs is as easy as
entering that command as number 0 on a list of 3 prime objectives. Fighting amongst
ourselves is hard enough without worry about a new conscious actor. If all the machine
needs to survive is power, and not man, is man then just a risk to machines without any
benefit?

Journeys and destinations
Journey and destination, you could focus on streets, or you could focus on
destinations. They’re both true, they’re both accurate. Using one of these methods,
you learn about paths and methods to do a thing; the other method, you learn about


```
the thing, and then categorize the paths that can get there. One of them makes you
good at the journey, maybe one of them makes you go to the single destination.
Scivive would argue that journeys have more possible outcomes than destinations do.

planned. So if you have that style of using your brain, it’s probably a good idea for you
to always have something that you’re waiting on that’s going to be awesome. Maybe

term thinking about a trip to some tropical island. If you are a person that responds

Date with destiny
Some part of you knows what the right thing is. Some part of you knows that
you’re not doing it to the level that you should. When you finally take your destiny,
and use the gifts that you’ve been given or have fought for, you’ll feel a fulfillment
that you can’t find any other way. You can’t find it through diversion, you can’t find it
through video games, and you can’t find it through another woman’s arms. You can
only find it by knowing that to some degree, for some part of your life, you’re living
your destiny. And when you do, it will become addictive. And it will be the best thing
you ever get addicted to.

**AMPLIFY: Personal Development/Improvements/ Tools /Strategies for achieving personal goals**
Compounding improvements
Whenever you have something with a few parts, and you can improve each of the
parts, the improvements all multiply by each other in ways you wouldn’t expect! For a
simple example, let’s say you have a website that sells a product called XYZ. This
example website will sell 1 product for 100 dollars with free shipping. 1 percent of
people that visit the site buy it. You pay 10 cents a click to google off an advertisement


that says “buy XYZ product at XYZ.com”. You get 1000 visits a day from your google
ad. Your profit per order before marketing cost is 35 dollars.
Your sales per day is $1000. Your profit per day is $350 minus the $100 you gave
google for the 1000 visitors to make your 1 sale. That’s $250 total profit per day. Now
this will blow your mind; for it to be properly blown, please take a second to write
down a real guess as to what you think the increase in profit will be if you do
everything 10 percent better.
Ok, now let’s do the experiment; you change your google ad to “XYZ only $100 at
XYZ.com this week!” Now you get 10 percent more clicks. You now pay less per click
(because google charges you less if you have a higher click to ad shown ratio.) So let’s
say you pay 10 percent less per click. Now you get 1100 visitors for $99. You improve
your website and now you get 1.1 sales per 100 visitors, and they charge 110 dollars
from you, and you receive better prices on XYZ from the manufacturer, so your profit
per order at 100 dollar sale price goes from $35 to $38.50, but you’re actually making
another free 10 dollars from being able to sell at 110 instead of 100.

If you have more parts you can improve, you get more compounding. So a little
improvement in lots of places is worth more than one large improvement in a
single place. Imagine if you cut your cost per product in half, you still wouldn’t
make as much as just making everything ten percent better. The point is, small
improvements that multiply each other are more profitable.

Synergy, immersion, Modifying meaning and belief etc. to get good at something
Magic of Meta Synergy
The magic of synergy Meta: This needs to go in the spirit section as well.
If you improve each of your skills that effect each other by 10 percent,
you get 100 percent more profit.
Hobbies synergy
Choose your hobbies wisely, you only have time for a few. Ideally they could
amplify each other! If you love having sex with beautiful people, it’d probably be great
if you loved exercise as well. If you just happened to enjoy being playful and fun, and
confident, all those hobbies would mesh wonderfully together. They’re not magic.
They can be learned and practiced like anything else. Therefore if your hobbies all
amplify each other, you get exponential returns. Look at it this way. Let’s do the math.
Let’s say you like to go to nightclubs. And let’s say you have a cool conversation with 1
out of 5 people you approach. Let’s then assume you have sex with one out of every
12 people you have good conversation with.
```
```
META: someone else can stick some examples mathematically in here using the
insights from “the magic of synergy”
```
```
Immersion, and getting good at something- Power
```
241. If the principle of the law of attraction was truly accurate then anyone that you
    saw with a high close count on a form of business start-ups or perhaps with a high
    profile on a website where people invest in things, I think it’s called angellist.co XX
    check this - many of those guys are obviously immersed and obviously have high
    hopes yet very few of them are wildly successful. Some of them, perhaps, even end up
    losing money. So it makes you wonder, doesn’t it enhance your likelihood to be
    constantly immersed in the language of some activity? Does it improve the likeliness
    that you’ll get good at it? Yes. But being near it is no excuse for being good at it. Being
    good is a hell of a lot harder than being near. By the way, finding things that other
    people haven’t noticed is a hell of a lot harder than thinking the same things everyone
    else thought of.
Modifying Meaning and belief to execute a specific program
188.Meaning and belief can be perspective changed. One can choose to enjoy the
    hardship, for every challenge fosters an opportunity. One can choose to see the pain
    as a goal, embracing it and wanting it. You can consciously chose that. Now, you are


conditioning your body to stop fighting, and say to yourself, “yep, this is what we do
now.” When we feel uncomfortable and the hardship kicks in, and the horror kicks in,
and the compulsion kicks in to read all the websites and play all the games and hook
up with all the girls and stop being conscious of my problems. You try to do whatever
it takes to stop existing in the hardship. You feel the need to execute a program so
hard and so fast or repeatedly over and over and over again until you can’t think
anymore. Because all of my thinking is now being used by the distractions, you are not
consciously allowing the hardships to affect you.
Choosing the meanings that empower you
Choose the meanings that empower you. You should choose the meanings in your
life that give you the most power. If you’re smart and creative, you can literally create
compelling meanings and perspectives from many different sides of an argument.
Hell, if you want to, you can even convince yourself of a lie, even live that lie. It’s all
fun and games until you wake up one day and the lie has exhausted itself and can’t
suppress the truth any longer. This causes some people to break, yet some people are
born again, greater.
What you think is fate is really popularity. Choosing meanings
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction_(New_Thought)
The above text on serendipity describes how what you think is fate, is really
popularity, confirmation bias, and the reticular activating system, not fate. ALSO YOU
get to choose meanings regardless of events, so you can call lots of things whatever
you want.

Programming for precursor behavior instead of results.
Even though jealousy doesn’t lead you directly to a specific outcome, since there is
a finite number of things that lead to the outcome that you want, it can still be a good
intermediary step that gets the same benefits eventually. For example, having kids
may follow the same “code”. You don’t have to program people to want to have kids,
but rather you have to program them to want to have sex, even though they don’t
want the kid. They want the sex and therefore end up having a child anyway because
the sex leads to children; so the intermediate step has produced the same outcome.
Just like school, you might not want to get a job, but you don’t want to get arrested or


have your parents yell at you so they tell you to go to school, and then in the end you
end up with a job that you are qualified for because you had the schooling.
Leveraging and ratcheting emotions & Behaviors to achieve
Staircases, happiness and antilock brakes. A widely applicable Powerful
Analogy(This could be split up to other sections like power& Mind)

```
Perhaps a ratcheting ebb and flow stair climb upwards is wise. Achieve, enjoy,
grow bored, move on up, and repeat the previous steps. Maybe that is an optimal
strategy? What is it that makes ratchets and stairs so much better than ramps
anyway? One could ponder what the universal principle is there. Are you leveraging
the power of starting friction by locking and unlocking like antilock brakes? Interesting
possibility. This is a great analogy for study. We use stairs instead of ramps because on
a ramp, it’s too easy to go from starting friction to rolling friction. With stairs, once
you get your foot and weight on the next step, it’s very hard to slide back down. This is
likely why we have so much segmentation and ratcheting in our emotions and
behaviors. Even find grained measurements are hard to make. For instance, why do
we only name ROYGBIV in the rainbow? Why not all the in-between colors? Why do
we count integers in base 10 instead of base 20? Why do we describe the tons of
music as highs, mids and lows? We’re amazingly course in our measurements and
even our feelings. We have 12 average feelings a day, total.
```
```
Xx Meta: Perhaps the coarseness of measurement fits well with the, no two rulers
are the same size perception issues. This is more of an emotional angle though, so I’d
probably leave this in emotions, rather than the idea that there’s no such thing as
equal in the physical world
```
Find empowering beliefs for things that happen
Stop saying everything happens for a reason. It doesn’t. Chance really does exist.
Thus whether there’s a good reason or not, you can still find an empowering belief out
of all events good or bad. And it can be tilted one way or the other; just go to any
casino and see for yourself how the biggest buildings in the southwest United States
are built on the slight tilting of chance.


```
If you’re stuck in thinking “life sucks” mode, you can be accurate and say, you turn
bad outcomes into good fortune wherever possible, and that can be both true and
empowering while allowing your world view to include that random events do truly
exist. Get all the benefits of saying “everything happens for a reason” and live in the
real world. You don’t need to destroy your understanding of the really useful
conception of chance in order to feel good.
Frustration & de-frustration timing- spirit
```
245. Due to the complicated nature of the world in which we find ourselves, the
    times in which frustration was properly timed to restrict resources while still engaging
    in risk-taking, adventurous behavior. Now the things that we need to do are so
    complicated that it’s very hard for us to see 5-minute, 10-minute and longer minute
    payoffs when things take decades now. So, we could benefit from using our minds and
    perhaps some type of chemical that de-frustrates us so that we can stay engaged in a
    task.
Select the activity instead of selecting excellence- Spirit
1. Isn’t funny that the Nike brand started out with Greek imagery, and Nike being the
    God of victory, and then the brand literally thought, “Oh, victory is too hard. What’s
    not too hard? Just doing it!” Forget about win or lose, just doing it has got be easier.
    This way, Nike has improved their customer base by including the winners and losers
    of any sporting activity. Do not always attempt to select for excellence, let’s just select
    for activity.
No immersion in mental space- Spirit & Schedule(Goes in alot of places)
1. So, when you’re trying to change the way you think about things, you have two
    options: The first option is that you can immerse yourself and make thinking the right
    way so easy that it’s what you do. You wake up, you don’t care whether you feel like it
    or not, you do the thing that you’re supposed to do; it’s scheduled and you just have
    to do it. And it doesn’t take will power because it’s engrained as a habit.
XX – clearly define option 2 somewhere in here before continuing

```
Well, mental habits are very similar to physical habits except that you don’t get the
ease of scheduling them. So you don’t get the ease to feel a certain way about a thing
because you’ve scheduled it. If you want to change the way you feel about reality
television per se, you can’t schedule a time to decide that you’re going to feel that
reality television is a waste of your time. You need to just program that emotion
without the short cut of immersion, without the short cut of scheduling. You can use
the NLP switch pattern kind of style: see this, do this, see that, do one thing and not
the other thing, not that NLP works for the most part but that one kind of does.
```

```
So what you end up with is the human emotion of frustration. Frustration is
triggered upon what is, it is not usually triggered by what is not. Okay? So greed is
triggered by what is not; conversely, greed is the thing that you want but don’t have
right now. And so, what doesn’t exist triggers greed, and therefore movement in that
direction. But frustration is, again, triggered by what is. Here is the thing and this thing
isn’t working, and now let’s go do the other thing.
```
Pulling & Pushing emotions
So, we’ve got pulling emotions and we’ve got pushing emotions; we’ve got
“towards” emotions and we have “away” emotions. And so, if you’re trying to build a
new belief, a new strategy, and a new way of thinking about things, as much as you
may try to always stay in a positive frame you’ll find that it’s harder and that
sometimes you just need to program and think about identifying the wrong way so
that it gives you a trigger that you notice. “Oh. I’m doing this the wrong way, let me do
it the right way.” Scivive doesn’t want you to live there. Don’t spend spend time there.
Think about problems only long enough to develop solutions, and focus on solutions.

```
But in the area of human thought, you don’t get to immerse yourself. Shit is going
to pop up, conversations are going to pop up, social media is going to pop up, and
you’re going to stub your toe. Life is going to happen, and then you’re basically you’re
back in “la la land” and you’re going to fall back into old habits and you need to know,
“Hey, old habit. Okay, I see it. It’s triggered me, now what do I do? What’s the right
habit?” And so, in this instance maybe your old habit was maximizing for market
share, maximizing for profitability and basically achieve the mindset of a salesman and
marketer. That alone is not going to save your life, that is not going to save your loved
ones’ lives, and that is not going to save the planet.
```
```
You need to program yourself and learn to think in a way where the profit
(sometimes financial, often times not financial) is the wholesome idea of getting of
human beings to take responsibility for saving their own lives. The sooner that you can
start justifying your actions, beliefs, thoughts, and behaviors by noticing your old
school style of profitability, and scale by saying, “Hey. That was great for then when
```

```
money was the object but money is not the object now,” therefore creating and
memorizing these new frame works of getting yourself to care about what really
matters.
```
QW.456
**Doing what you know you should do**
Motivation and desire are wildly more important than knowledge.
The world is not short on things to know. There are an infinite amount of complex
things that can engulf all of your time that you may never fully understand; those
things don’t matter. What matters most is doing the things that we already know that
we should do.

```
It’s funny how much effort and time goes into the education system and not the
motivation system. Kids would be better off dedicating 50% of their time getting
motivated to do shit and 50% of their time learning what they needed to, to do those
things. That would be better than spending 100% of their time learning things they
will never use, can’t use, don’t want to use, or shouldn’t learn. How many people have
a collection of exercise equipment in their house that goes unused? How many people
have the ability to do push-ups because they have arms and they have a floor? How
many are unsure of the tools needed to exercise or unsure of the knowledge on how
to exercise? We are short on the desire to exercise, not the knowledge of how it can
be done.
```
```
If you compare the papers that have been released in the systems of doctrinaire
and education and you compare all of the output in regards to IQ testing and testing
instead of motivation testing and score; memory, reasoning, and creativity ability
instead of motivational ability; It just seems like getting things done is the most
important thing but the least taught thing.
```
```
123.T
The world does not need more knowledge, the world needs more motivation.
```

```
With the advent of forty dollar tablets, and twenty dollar smart phone, and
somebody else being able to watch it and tell you how to do it. You could do anything
you want for yourself if you are motivated to watch a video and try it.
428.If a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in order to create some
positive benefit to the world, you need to know how to do a thing and then actually
do the thing. Well then, which of these two is the weaker thing? Is the world more
lacking in the ability to do things or is it more lacking in the desire to do things? And
Scivive will tell you what the world is missing is desire. Everyone would have a six pack
and everyone would be fit and everyone would spend time with their families and
everyone would do all of the things that they know they should do but they don’t
have lack of knowledge on how; they have a lack of desire to do so. QW.428
```
Discipline beats motivation
Discipline is more useful than motivation. Measure the 2 mindsets, see where all
the good shit in the world is coming from. You will likely find a bunch of tortured souls
that are out there kicking ass while sad, as opposed to the happy go lucky potheads
who are not producing anything.
Difference between motivation and discipline is
Discipline is the most direct bare-metal doing of the thing possible, and motivation
is not doing the thing, it’s doing the emotions around the thing, and emotions are very
slippery and they’re very hard to hold on to. So let’s say you wanted to hit something
with a stick. Discipline is... You grab the stick and you immediately hit it. Motivation is
you circle jerk yourself and make yourself happy and make yourself feel good about it,
then maybe you reach and grab the stick because you feel good doing it.

# MONEY

## Capitalism

The economies of the United States and most industrialized nations around the world are
based on a model of capitalism. In its most basic interpretation, under a capitalist system, private
individuals own and control the means of production; this is in contrast to socialism, where the
government owns and controls the means of production.
In capitalism, consumer demand drives production and consumption. Capitalism gives
consumers more of what they want and are willing to pay for, and less of what they don’t want
and are not willing to pay for.
What people want usually isn’t so great, because unfortunately it is often not going to save
anyone’s life. Bigger houses, faster cars, more expensive jewelry—how many of these things are
what you will remember on your deathbed as what mattered?
As an entrepreneur, you must choose: do you want to get rich the easy way first by giving
people what they want, and then try and do good in the world (the Bill Gates method); or should
you take the harder route, and get rich by making the world a better place along the way?

### Technology and Innovation....................................................................................................

Technology is letting us do some cool things today that we couldn’t do before. In Sweden,
there’s a program that if you give blood and your blood is used to save somebody, you receive
notification about that. Well, that’s pretty cool if people are going to do good things and get good
results for the world. It seems like a great idea to actually let them know about it, and like a great
idea to reward good behavior.
There is also an app that allows you to act as the eyes of a blind person. When a blind person
might need to see something they need a description for, they can show it with their smartphone
and let someone else tell them what their phone is looking at.
There are other cool things, like utilizing an unoccupied car sitting in a parking lot. In the
world that has the ability to transport people and goods, this reduces the number of cars on the


road because we can use all the cars that are just sitting at rest in parking lots to do good things
for the world and move people around. Then you don’t need as many cars; you could take the
fewer cars that you have and get more performance out of them.
That’s why Uber is worth billions of dollars even though they don’t really own any cars.
They’ve created a strategy whereby other people that have unused resources like cars (or like Air
BnB did with housing) that were going underutilized, now we can maximally utilize the things
that we’ve already worked hard to build and maintain.
There’s probably some more industries that have underutilized assets that somebody is going
to come in make a couple billion dollars off of find a way for us to get more of what we already
have.
Let that person be you!
The checkpoint is that if you were restrict the pool to a small set of years that are introduced
technologically and not through lifestyle and health change. You know people then would have
to work on the technology. The benefits of the other side of that checkpoint are economic
benefits by not having to pay for that last year of life whose medical costs are equal to all the
previous years of life combined, and the insane increases in proactivity by having the smartest,
most effective, most productive scientists and researchers, the avengers of the world.
What if Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell were awarded a couple more years just to
finish up those things they didn’t complete? We could have had more scientific and economic
benefit. The same greatness is expected of you. Utilize your extra years doing positive things for
the world; maybe you use one extra year off your life to say goodbye to your family and tick
some boxes off of your bucket list.

### The Funny Thing About Money

The funny thing about money is that if you properly get the most value from it, and turn it into
goods and services, you don’t actually have it anymore. If you used it to buy a business, what
you really bought was goods and services for other people, because that is what businesses do.
Really all the cool things that people want, that they need money to buy, they don’t really go in
the money section, and they go in the environment section.


Now in theory, the things that you could own but not have in your environment would just
really affect your internal environment emotionally knowing that you own them, even though
you wouldn’t be physically in their presence.

## Mindset

Imagine that when you closed your eyes, millions of dollars were put in your bank account,
and sometimes they were taken out. They came and went like breath. Would you feel it? Then
why do you care so much about how much money you have that you’re not using? Once you
become wealthy, you feel the need to get more and more, and for most, it never goes away. The
greed and the desire is real, and you become trapped by success. You become your work, you
become your bank account, and it’s a terrible thing to happen to anyone really, for how can one
cleanly decide what one wants from life when there is so much risk involved with changing,
while one gets so much reward by staying the same?

### Valuing Income Over Savings

Some people are happy to get a 50% discount someplace where they’re valued. Others are
happy to say they get half off the planet, because they’ve got twice the income.

### The Importance of Gratitude

“If you’re so smart, how come you aren’t rich?”
“If you ain’t rich, life’s a bitch.”
Warren Buffett, the difference between rich people, and really rich people, is that really rich
people say “no” to almost everything.
This is the world we live in today. Some people have lots of stuff, and some people have no
stuff, and when you think about how that actually occurs at the micro level, it goes as follows:
You wake up in the morning, have a nice coffee and a shower, and you decided you’re going
to build yourself a nice addition on your house. Nope. You can’t, because you have to go build
an addition on someone else’s house instead, so that you can buy food and pay your rent. What
you find is that your days are almost constantly going to enrich the lives of other people instead
of yourself, because well, one, you don’t really want more of what you can already do for


yourself, you’re probably bored of it by now; and two, you are in debt because you need so many
things from everyone else around you. You wouldn’t have the time in the day to both go pick
your own food, and water your own lawn, and take the kids to school. You get the idea. So the
point is, in this world, instead of spending your days improving your existence by your own
hands, you improve others existence.
Look at it this way: I want you to imagine that you were the only person in the world. You
needed to pick your own food, build your own shelter, make your own fires, etc. One day you
decided that you wanted to build a house, and in that house you would like to have some
furniture. How long would it take you to put it together? Perhaps you’d never have a house at all,
but you’d give up and just try to find a comfy cave to stay in.
Now why is this interesting enough to even mention? For the reason that you have to be more
happy about what you have in this world. And if you have lots, it’s because you have quite
literally robbed and starved other people of the fruits of their own labor. So you really should
appreciate it. If you currently own, use, and benefit exclusively from lots of stuff, and you
couldn’t have built all that stuff on your own, you better get grateful.
Someone else had to build something for you, instead of themselves, or you wouldn’t have it,
unless they died and left it to you.

### Money and Power Isn’t Everything

Check out the video of Barack Obama, while president of the USA, interviewing Jack Ma,
founder of Alibaba, and a multibillionaire. Jack Ma says his biggest regret was starting Alibaba,
the company that made him a multibillionaire, and put him in the center of the stage with our
president off to the side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WACqJ28OJUY (APEC CEO summit 2015)

### Ownership

Why would you want to own anything that has periods of loss greater than two to five years?
You would be better off not owning anything in that case. Unless perhaps you’re hedging?

### Business Ownership Vs Solitary Profession


Owning a business is an easier way for making lots of money than a solitary profession.
The most solitary professions are also often the hardest to compete in. Since the most
rewarded and powerful concept in the world we live in is the concept of ownership and property,
then anything related to business, investment, and capitalism in general is aligned with that most
powerful of principles. Thus, you kind of get to cheat the system a bit, because not everyone else
is interested in taking advantage of that capitalist magic for themselves. This leaves you the free
profit left on the table that they weren’t interested in. So they go off and compete against each
other in the dog-eat-dog areas of art, or fiction writing, or music, instead of business. It’s like
going off to war with no guns or weapons, and just going bare handed. Sure, you might be able
to do ok, but it’s much easier if you take a force multiplier with you.
If you choose a solitary way to make money, you’ve left behind some of the easiest “don’t
leave your force” multipliers behind. Don’t try to change the tire on your car without a jack.
Don’t try to skydive without a parachute. Don’t try to get rich without ownership.
The most successful solitary professionals, like novelist Stephen King and JK Rowling, create
works that can be leveraged into mass-marketed products, such as movies.

### Productive Land

A useful trait that buying productive land or companies has is that you’re less likely to sell the
whole thing off and more likely to spend only out of your profit, than you are with a stock or
other lump sum speculative instrument. It’s harder to separate in your mind that you had a profit
from a trade, and that you should only spend the profit. You can also much more easily find
yourself without any income or any gain, or having to sell of a little part of your business every
time to create profit, because that’s what it is. If your stock appreciates and you want to eat, you
have to sell some of your stock, so you’re actually constantly owning less and less of that actual
productive thing that you own, which is the company, because you need to get money out to eat.
That’s not beneficial. That’s part of the reason that when someone tells you that you need to
use compounding interest, save forever and never take anything out, because one day when you
can’t go back in time and buy back quality of life in earlier years, you have more money than
you need. Yay. Now you have more than you need, by going without for so long.
Scivive is not very interested or excited about testing to the limit of everyone’s delayed
gratification muscle. Scivivors would rather see you become excellent and make money by


making the world a better place than sitting on your ass and letting compounding interest try to
make up for your personal lacking. Go forth and kick ass, forget about compounding interest.

### The $75,000 Happiness Myth

They say you need only make $70,000 a year to get maximum emotional benefit.
Scivive probably won’t reference the science of this stuff, and make it more folks
knowledgeable.
I don’t like this $ 75 ,000 thing [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full,](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full,)
Let’s look at how inaccurate this number is.
Do you have addictions like gambling and drugs? You need more money.
Do you have kids and a trophy wife? You need more money.
Do you live in a super expensive place like San Francisco or New York City? You need more
money.
Are you terrible with finance and have lots of debt you need to pay off? You need more
money.
Saving up for retirement? Well is that 5, 10, 20 percent of your salary? You need more
money.
With all the variance between different locations, lifestyles, and luck, it seems pretty silly to
slap $ 75 ,000 on the price tag and call it the price of happiness. How useful is this number to
people living outside the United States? Not very. How does one see if the cost of living adjusted
this? That would make it slightly better. How many people do you know that actually got rich
this way, only through compounding interest?

### Unfair World

If you look at anybody that’s really wealthy and they have something expensive, that took
many people a long time to build. Maybe it’s a house, maybe it’s a car. It just shows kind of the
unfairness in the world that ten people had to sacrifice all of their time for the joy and benefit of
one person. It’s a little bit interesting, and why do they do that?
Because he was here first, it’s a little weird.

### Stupid Copyright Law


Our small world programming for property being a thing and making great sense was
extended to these new giant things that we couldn’t dream of back then, and it’s rather perverse.
Intellectual property is even funnier, how can you own an idea? Literally own it. And then own it
50 years after you are dead. Do you really need to own stuff while dead?
The mega-corporations win every day, the public loses.

### Get Rich Slow

Let’s be serious, if everyone that read a book on how to get rich, acted on it, and became rich,
there wouldn’t be many poor people in the world. How easy it would be to read a get rich quick
book and get rich quickly? The world has no shortage of get rich quick books, but you could say
that the world does have a shortage of rich people. So how does that happen? You could say that
reading a book on its own doesn’t do much. These types of books have been coming out for
hundreds of years.
People sell you on doing what they used to do, but not what they’re doing now. You’ll see
that they found greatness the minute they stopped doing what they’re trying to sell you and
started doing what they’re doing to sell you. They’re selling shovels to gold miners, not mining
for gold.
You only hear about the fake, feel good, not hard work methods of improvement. Rarely will
someone tell you that in order to kick ass and outcompete others, you have to learn the hard shit
that you didn’t want to learn in school, because that’s the most useful stuff. Like statistics, and
the method of loci, and excel formulas. It’s not fun, it’s not pretty, and it’s the real world. The
real, sustainable world desires facts and figures, and feats of artistic excellence, all of which
require time, effort, dedication and a foundation of study that has no shortcuts. Good luck getting
people to buy that book.
No one buys the “Get rich slow” scheme.
What if they do? What if people are so disillusioned by the get-rich-quick schemes that if
someone actually just told them step by step how to get rich in two years, country specific.
Goddamn if they don’t want to read that stuff, the people who actually willing to work to become
rich.

### Wealth Velocity (Getting It Now, the When)


If you really want to make the world healthier, happier and smarter, billions of dollars are
going to be generated. The difficulty of how hard it is to make genuine change in people’s lives
through for-profit corporations. It’s much easier to negatively affect people’s lives with a for-
profit corporation, because there’s more barriers to entry which allows for profit.
Things that influence people at younger years and things that influence people at older years,
everyone that’s joined the giving pledge, they were reached out by a man, who tried and spent
hundreds of millions of dollars in charitable endeavor. Good ideas cause absolutely gigantic
multiplier effects in money, that no matter how hard you work, you will never be able to achieve
personally.
If you tell someone, “Listen, build my client’s new house this week. I’m going to pay you on
Friday,”
He says, “I don’t think you’re going to have the money to pay me on Friday. I need to get
paid on Monday.”
Then you go to the person who’s paying to get the house built and you say, “I wouldn’t
normally need so much money upfront, but everyone wants to be paid on Monday instead of
Friday now, so I need more money upfront.”
And that guy replies, “It doesn’t look like you’ve got control of your workforce, maybe you
pay them on Monday and the house never gets built, so I don’t feel comfortable giving you the
money now.” So it just goes up the chain.
That’s the paralysis of this boom and bust cycle, where you give away credit for free and then
you constrict it. When it constricts, everyone goes into safety/security/savings mode, and then
the money multiplier effect causes the money not to get spent.
In case you didn’t know it, the money multiplier effect means that for every dollar you spend,
that’s someone else’s income.
For every dollar that you give someone who’s selling something to you, they now are very
likely to spend roughly 80% of it. It’s different in different societies. In America, we have a very
high money multiplier effect because we have a very low propensity to save, whereas in China,
they have a very high propensity to save, and therefore their money multiplier effect is lower. If
you were to put $100 of your own money into building something in China, the net benefit to
that economy would multiply less. It would turn over fewer times, because it would get
suctioned off into savings and buried in the ground, or whatever form of savings that they would


perform. The funny thing about savings is that unless they just bury it in the ground, if they put it
into a bank, the bank tries to counter-reallocate it.
If you’re in a country that has a big propensity to save, you’re probably also of the mindset
that you don’t want to take additional loans, because that’s the opposite of saving. Taking on
debt and owing people money is the opposite of having extra money. In countries where people
save more, those people also probably also take out less loans, and thus are less likely to have
exponential growth because the money multiplier isn’t as strong.
When people want to make a lot of money and get rich, I try and tell them to get on the sales
side, because it’s got exponential growth capacity, whereas cost savings, manufacturing
differences and those things do not have exponential growth capacity at all unless you combine
them with the required sales increases.

### Pennywise, Dollar Foolish

The way that human beings treat large purchases with less care than they do small purchases,
like the purchase of a house or starting a business opportunity/franchise versus buying a new pair
of shoes, pretty much means that those industries are the most ripe for unethical business tactics,
because the same unethical tactics earn you more than they would with lower ticket items.
People usually spend more time investigating a two-hundred-dollar television purchase than
they will a two-hundred-thousand-dollar house or a two-hundred-thousand-dollar business. This
is because we do not properly allocate our conscious decisions on these giant, hard to understand
numbers.

A dollar saved is a dollar earned. A pound lost stays lost forever. Original quotes I don’t like
in form, however, I do like in function, “A penny saved is a penny earned,” or “Pennywise,
pound foolish,”—linear expectations for constant correct behavior. Every dollar you save now,
every dollar you save stays. Same with calories.

## Managing Your Expenses

### New Car Lease Vs. Buy


The point at which a car goes down in value the fastest is when it drives off the factory lot,
which makes good sense because why would you pay the same for a car that just drove off the
lot, when you could walk a couple feet farther, and have a direct relationship with the dealer.
Thus, when you lease a new car, and you keep getting new leased cars every couple of years,
you keep losing the maximum amount of value on the car because you keep paying for it during
the period when its value is going down the fastest.
You also pay the maximum number of transaction overhead costs and visits to the dealer, and
spending time choosing which car and specs you want. Then on top of all that, you’re also
paying extra interest on borrowing the money to pay back the loan that you got to pay for a car
that is going down in value the fastest it ever will during its lifetime. Oh, and you’ve entered the
“GOTHCA went over mileage” insane fees lottery, or other hidden fees lottery. And you have to
have a higher spec of insurance sometimes to protect the leasing company’s interest in your car.
Thus, if you want to save money on a great car, you can own it when it goes down in value
slower, after some other dumb-dumb has already paid to drive it off the lot for you. Another fun
fact, let’s say you buy a performance car like a BMW M3, you can’t even rev the engine to max
during the first couple thousand miles because the engine is still breaking in. Why would you
want to own a performance car during the period when its performance is crippled?
Also you’re forced to do extra transactions after a lease, whereas if you own, you can just
hold forever, and skip the transactional costs and friction.

### Those Little Expenses Can Crush You

“It’s only 10 bucks a month.” It’s easy to say that, because you look at your total income and
think “what’s 10 bucks out of 2400 dollars a month?” But is that the right way to look at it? You
have real bills you have to pay every month. So why don’t we take that 10 bucks out of the
money you actually have available to you. 40 hours, 15 dollars an hour. $600. 4 weeks in a
month. $2400. Minus rent $1200. Gas $200. Phone $60. Car insurance $100. Food $1500.
Internet $60. So now what you really have left is 2400-(1200+200+60+100+1500+60)= $-720.
So it’s really 10 bucks a month out of $720. Uh oh. You do pay taxes right?
So in the $30,000 bracket you lose about 18% to taxes. Which leaves you with only $1968 a
month. So it’s really = $- 1152


Now if you never buy yourself clothes, never see a movie, never have to fix your car, never
take a flight, never get a speeding ticket, never have any other expenses at all, your just 10 bucks
a month is actually 10/1152. 1968 - (1200+200+60+100+1500+60)= $-1152 Wow. So if you
spend 1200 on rent and 1500 on food, you’re already gone over budget by 25% of your salary
after tax. So uh. You’re already in debt $1152 a month before you gave away the just 10 bucks.
It’s hard to show how important 10 dollars is, when you can’t even divide it into a positive
number, but are already in debt, so you have to just add it to your monthly debt. Let’s say you
only eat McDonald’s meals. $6 a big mac. So 3 meals a day, 30 days, $6*90=540. Let’s say you
get your rent down to only $800 a month. Now you are at
$1968-(800+200+60+100+540+60)=$208.00 So just 10 bucks is going to come out of the
$200 you have left end of month, if you never buy anything, ever and only eat McDonald’s
meals, no desserts, ever.
Oh, and we forgot electricity, water, garbage, home insurance, health insurance, girlfriend,
pet, family, cable. So, you’re pretty much screwed. Do not give your money away. What about
all those other things that show up on your credit card bill that you never got around to
canceling?
You probably need to eat rice and beans, and pay down that debt. Affordable healthy food is
a great start to making money appear where there was none.

## Jobs

### Automation Is Our Friend

Imagine 100 years ago you were a concert musician, and you heard that there was a new
device that was going to take your job. This magical device would allow people to record a better
musician than you, on the same instrument that you play, and everyone else in the world would
be able to listen to that better musician perhaps with a better instrument from the comfort of their
home, over and over again for free.
You would be pretty scared and pissed off right? You would no longer be as needed as you
once were. The benefits you would need to provide people in order for them to choose seeing
you and hearing you instead of seeing or hearing the recording of a better musician would have
to increase. The point is, what makes a better world? Are there more people listening to music or


performing it? It is obvious the world is better off with the ability to make recordings of our
loved ones and music and film. The world is vastly better off than it once was, and yes, at some
time in the long ago past, some musicians actually had to take a hit, for the world to become
greater.
What’s the solution?
Pay the affected minority.
It is always better to move the world ahead at the cost of a small minority, for that small
minority can be easily compensated out of the mass earnings that come from implementing the
better world, if you choose to do so, or they can just live off the saved earnings their monopoly
power used to afford them. Or they could be re-trained for new jobs.
Peak horse population occurred in 1920 in the United States. The car made the world a better
place than the horse. Few people today know that the citizens of New York were worried they
would be literally covered in feet-deep horseshit over time, because it was accumulating faster
than they could clear it. Not to mention the thousands of dead horses that had to be carted away
and turned into glue.

### Laying Off $15/hr Workers Is Good for $5/hr Workers

Consumers demand better quality products at ever lower prices. Businesses produce goods
and services for their customers and usually maintain a workforce of people to execute the tasks
required to fulfill their customers. Usually when lots of employees are laid off, it is because there
has been a downturn in business, or the jobs have been moved to somewhere where the people
will work for cheaper. This is complained about by the employees and by the general public and
politicians. It’s often not complained about by the company managers and shareholders, though,
and often the value of the company rises. So what’s going on here? Why is it that the same event
causes such a difference in emotion? Well the answer you see, in that case, is that the workers do
not care about the plight of the poorer people who are now doing for less the same job they used
to do for more. They couldn’t care less about those people. The workers do not know their
names, haven’t been where they live, and often can’t even speak the same language, so it’s quite
easy for them to ignore the plight of the people that need the jobs more.
The people in charge of the company are legally obligated to look after the shareholders’
interest by maximizing the profit of the company. If there’s worse off people in the world that


can do the same job as well as or better than the higher paid better-off people currently doing it,
it’s the directors of the company’s job to do the more profitable thing.
While the flight of jobs from the United States in the 1990s and beyond was bad for American
workers, it was a boon to Asian workers who would work for less money. The shift helped lift
millions of people out of grinding poverty across the globe.
Automation taking jobs is great. Thus, the man who invented the phonograph, which allowed
us to make recordings of sound and play the sounds back where and when we wished, did the
world a great, great favor. We have similar improvements to our technical abilities as a race quite
often these days. Nearly anything that slows that progress shrinks the pie from which we all must
eat. Technology enlarges the pie for all, and it’s the job of our social systems and governments to
make sure that no one party is overly harmed in that progress, and to redistribute the earnings
from technological progress across the people. There is no good in this world but for that which
benefits man. Without man, there is no good.
Funny enough, if you don’t appreciate wealth redistribution, you must never have met a man
destroyed by wealth. Too much wealth is much more a burden than a blessing. How many lottery
winners are better off from becoming wealthy? The point is, owning a thing basically just means
the right to make sure other people don’t get to use it. It’s a right of exclusion. How noble is that
really? How beneficial is it that you get to control the location and use of a thing exclusively?
Seems pretty greedy when you put it that way.
Thus, technology is all that will save us. Some groups will get less pie of the enlarged whole,
it’s the job of governments and society in general to see that these harmed parties are still made
well, so that other parties in the future see less benefit in slowing down the progress of the world.
The means of solving the problems of the middle and lower classes is outside the abilities of
technology. The rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting richer, except in percentage
terms compared to the rich.
Wouldn’t it be funny if we lived in a world where there were only very, very wealthy men
who lived on the moon, and left all their possessions here on earth? We would live in their
houses, swim in their swimming pools, and they would never bother to even see them. Of what
use is owning a thing you can’t see, and do not use? It’s social signaling value, and fulfilling
your greed, or hoarding desire.


The point is, don’t hinder technology to try and make up for bad governance and wealth
distribution. If you do, you’ll still have a bad government, and you’ll still be broke, however,
you’ll also have no cool tech.

### Caring About the World Beyond Your Paycheck

How many people want a job, any job that pays well and isn’t too hard? Why would one
restrict themselves to a vision that sees no farther than their paycheck and day at work? We live
in a world where people don’t really care too much about what the actual result of the work
they’re doing is. If people cared more to be doing work that actually made the world a better
place, than it would cost less to get people for those wholesome and productive jobs than it costs
currently.
If more people cared to work on empowering things, then more empowering things would get
done, because it would leave less people available to do the work that was shittier, driving up the
cost of shittier work, in an attempt by employers to fill the positions. Thus as a thought
experiment, if more people wanted to plant trees, then there would be more tree planters in the
world, because the price would be lower per tree planter, and if less high pressure tactic scam
salesman wanted to do the job, then the pay would increase, and there would be less high
pressure sales people. Thus we would live in a better world if people cared more specifically
about what the outcome of what their labor was, outside themselves.

### Stay Close to the Source of Revenues..................................................................................

Just like protein turns into muscle easier, muscle is protein the same way that being sales turns
into higher pay for you easier because you generate higher profits for the company. It makes it
easier for them to give you what you yourself are creating, whereas if you create software instead
of money, you are easier to consider a place for money to go out, instead of place where money


comes in. This is because for every extra layer away from the physical check that gets written,
the easier it is to see you as an expense.

## Business

### The Value of Catalysts

Curation and catalyzing is super valuable. Shouldn’t other curators and lubricants, catalysts,
introducers, and networkers be similarly rewarded for performing the same functionality as
synapses in the global super-consciousness? How valuable is the firing pin and primer to a
bullet? What’s worth more, the spark or the flame? Depends on how many flames you have
right? Zero flames, spark is everything. Lots of flames make sparks less valuable.

### The Power of Contracts

You sign a single piece of paper, the whole weight of the government and men with guns
takes your stuff at gunpoint to make sure that you keep your word. Contracts are cool. Love the
contract. Good contracts make good friends.

### Stupid Job Offerings

Treat your potential employees with the same respect you treat your customers when you
market to them. Do not command them. Do not insult them. Respect them. For some reason
these days when you look for a job, you’ll see tons of fluff and bullshit.
When you write a job offer, if no normal human being would use any of the phrases to
describe themselves that you’re “looking” for. Then you’re just disqualifying all the people who
are actually qualified. Do you really give a damn about half these things? If you make your
requirements so fantasy based, the only applicants you will get are those that are more than
happy to lie to you, and pretend they meet these bullshit specs. No honest person feels
comfortable applying to such a fantastic list of nonsense. There might actually be 0 people on the
planet that match these specs. Easy things like, 10 years of experience required using a tool that’s
only existed for 5. Why do you care how many years someone has worked with a thing? Does


years using a thing actually point to competency? If a person bashes one’s own big toe with a
hammer for 10 years, does that make that person a master carpenter?
It doesn’t matter what you have done, it matters what you can do. Fluffy word-laden bullshit
fantasy paragraphs describing humans that don’t and really shouldn’t exist, serves 1 and only 1
purpose; to make your HR person look like they’re useful. If you HR person writes stupid ads
like this, fire them. These types of job postings do more harm than good.

## Why


### Double or Nothing Until You Call It Even, Then Bounce

I used to play poker when I was supposed to be studying in school in between classes. I’d be
able to deal standing up while I was walking around and it was a lot of fun. I had this one friend
named T.D. and T.D. would lose a lot. We used to play very volatile style, and he would owe me
a lot of money. He would say double or nothing, and we would do double or nothing and he
would lose, double or nothing and he would lose again. Now he owed me so much money that he
could never pay it back, and since he would never be able to pay me anyway, why don’t I just let
him double or nothing until he was even, and then maybe we can get him to lose an amount he’d
be comfortable paying.
That’s what life is, because of bankruptcy and because we don’t have debtors prisons, and
prisons full of slaves. (or at least not there because of the slavery.) Then if you are the risk taking
type of guy who’s willing to double or nothing enough times, all you need to do to be rich is just
to leave off on a double win, because when you lose you don’t go under negative, just file
bankruptcy and you go back to zero. It’s an asymmetrical war. You have a call option on the
progress of the world. You take risk, double or nothing, double or nothing, stop on a double. If it
doesn’t work out, you don’t go into the negatives, you just go to zero, because you are able to
wipe out your debt like that. People that are constantly rolling nothings eventually get a double.

### Working a Job Vs Owning a Business

When you own a business, you help many people. When you work a job, you help one person,
your boss, assuming the company has a single owner. It’s kind of like that.
You’ll get more from serving others than you could ever get serving yourself.
The sooner you start helping everyone else get what they want, the sooner you can hire a team
of people who focus solely on making your life better, so you don’t have to. New computers
coming out? They migrate you. New restaurant opening, you’re already there on opening night,
because their job is to spend 40 hours a week making your life awesome. The sooner you can
benefit others at scale, the sooner you can reflect that scale back to yourself, and have multiple
people doing fulltime, what you could never have the time, inclination, or perhaps ability to do
for yourself.


It’s easy to think that what makes a man rich is what he does. In fact, what makes a man rich
is what everyone else does. Bill Gates isn’t wealthy because he started a business, he’s wealthy
because the entire world bought his products. It is the world and its systematic behavior that
causes things to happen. This way you can understand better that a different human Bill Gates
would have emerged having performed the same task perhaps at a different time. There has to be
some merit in shifting the focal point externally. I know it accounts for monopoly.
If the government doesn’t enforce your contracts or keep people from stealing your ideas and
customers and goods, what do you have? Commerce is only possible through a group communal
enforcement of goods. It’s the system of other people that allows you to do whatever business
you wish, more so than it is your raw desire. You’re probably already copying and using the
same ideas and principles that have existed for thousands of years. Let’s give society and the
system the respect it’s easy to forget is deserved in the nice first world. If you were to try and
operate a business in the 3rd world, you’d quickly long for a real court and real police.
You have to put things in the right perspective. Look at the whole world. Give a random
person one million dollars, or take away a million dollars. One’s quality of life in regards to
longevity, health, and enjoyment of life won’t be greatly affected. But if some huge
breakthrough is found that cures a disease that might develop, or if some new popular thing
comes along that brings great joy to one’s life, the things that may or may not make that person’s
life more enjoyable or longer or healthier have much more to do with things outside of control
whether that person has that million dollars or not.
Look at the Tesla car, for example. It’s the safest car, it’s the fastest car, and whether you had
a million dollars or not, you couldn’t buy one until someone with a couple hundred million
dollars put money on the line to invent it, build it, make it available, and allow you to be aware
of it. And so, if you’re truly globally conscious, you’ll minimize the degree to which you think
your money is going to make a huge effect in your life, and maximize the degree to which
everyone else’s productivity will.

### Your Focus

Focus on something that someone else actually cares about that you can solve a problem for.
Study marketing tactics, a lot of people get to choose price points, maybe in this industry one
price point beats another price point. Study color scheme, what color scheme should your


website be? Does orange actually make people hungrier? Does hunger actually sell more of your
product? Study timing, study cross sales, study up-sales, and study something that can
exponentially grow so that you can solve somebody’s problem financially. Don’t study things on
the cost side that you can’t get exponential growth from. “Oh, I reduced your costs to zero. A
linear benefit. Please let me get a little bit of money, please sir?” And then, it’s not applicable
across industries usually. “Oh, I found you a way to make this product without using this
chemical so now you save more money.”
“Okay. Well, great. What does that got to do with selling tea in China? Not a thing.”
Goods and services are all that matter. If goods and services are how we measure the
productive output of the world, then you only have two choices for making honest money in this
life. If you start out as most of us do in this world, then you have to work for a living. If your
choices are to perform services or make or sell products, Scivive strongly suggests you go the
products route.

### Products Are Better Than Services

Products are better than services. A lot better. When you sell the hours of your life for money,
you never find more hours to sell. You can also never increase your product range. You only
have the hours you have. The best you can do is improve the market into which you sell your
service, the hours of your life. You raise the price on your services. This is called getting a new
job, and finding a new boss to pay you.
With products, you can scale up. You can expand your product range, expand your sales into
other states and countries, get better prices, have special offers, package it better, offer it with
other things, cross sell, upsell, cobrand, private label, on and on and on. And now you have a
brand that has value of its own. You not only have a future, and options, you can also make 10
time more sales every year, for quite a few years.
Now let’s say you instead start a service “business” and now you’re relying on the most
unreliable thing you’re likely to find. Teach your first apprentice? Great! Now you have your
first competitor. You want to serve 10 times more customers in a year? It’s easier to sell 10 times
more boxes, quite hard to do 10 times more house calls.
If you want help doing something, you need only dream what tickles your fancy. If you are
driven by curiosity, like many are, it creates a drive in you that is not easily overcome.


Let’s say that you thought about a cool new idea that would solve a problem you have, and
you decided that you would go forth and solve this problem and execute that cool idea you had.
Then you remembered one of the tenets of a Scivivalist, which is if you work hard to solve a
problem for yourself, and that problem isn’t well solved for other people, then you should take
the time required, in this ever shrinking and more niche, crowdfunded world to solve that
problem for others. Now you not only get to enjoy the solved problem for yourself, you also get
to enjoy the profit and prestige that comes from making others’ lives better.

#### When the Curiosity Dries Up

Here is where you might run into a problem. Imagine now that the problem you had was well
solved by the idea you executed. Now the original drive and curiosity is gone. If you want to
remain engaged with the project, you must find a new drive and curiosity. What is it about the
project you just finished for yourself that would make you interested in solving it for other
people? Well, what cool thing could you do with the prestige or money that would come from
solving the problem for others?

#### Finding the New Drive

Perhaps by getting everyone else’s capital committed you could solve the problem even
better, with a better material, better rounded edges, a better feel or sound, whatever you have in
your mind. Nevertheless, the idea is the same; whatever you solved once for yourself, you could
probably solve again for yourself in a better way if you had more money available. Why
wouldn’t you have 100 times the money available? Surely, as a true Scivivalist problem solving
master, you could find over 100 other people in the world with the same problem. (Otherwise
you would have picked a different problem to solve in the first place.)

### Manifesting Reality

Try this for fun. Take something that you want, anything, and plop it in your mind. Boom,
There it is, the thing of your desire! It is now sitting on a well-lit white stage in your mind’s eye.
Now let’s dream this dream backwards. How did what you want get there to that stage? Ok, and
what came before that, and before that, and before that, until you get to where you are right now,


sitting down, reading these fine words. We’ve dreamt a very rough path that is possible for what
you want to become reality. The challenge is that it just takes so damn long, and so much effort.
Unless perhaps what you dreamt was a sandwich, in which case, hit the refrigerator and quench
your desire at once.
That last part is quite common. Knowing your outcome, visualizing your destiny, and
dreaming the future, that’s been common knowledge for quite a long time. This part is new; we
looked at steps on the path to what you want, for they’re obviously just as important. You will
not get where you want to go without hitting some waypoints along the way. Teleportation isn’t
going to happen. Going backwards and visualizing those waypoints is super important, for it
enhances the chance that you will reach the first of them, and then the next, and the next, and so
on.
So we did some backwards way-pointing. Cool. What other awesome thing could we do? A
creativity exercise could be beneficial. Let’s imagine as well as we can, that whatever you
dreamt, it instantly became true, for giggles. And so as to not go off the rails into not doable la-la
land, let’s stick to dreaming things instantly coming true just in the direction of that think that’s
sitting on that well-lit stage in your mind.

### Delicious Details

Here we go, use this example to give it a try, use something that has been in your mind for a
while already, so it’s a little easier for you to follow the waypoints. Let’s use a common one, a
website idea. On your stage you can visualize the website. Back in the old days you might have
dreamt it as a building, but how many people can you positively touch with a building that
contains a single business?
At the top of your website is a beautiful call to action, a headline, something that the people
visiting would actually care to hear and read about. It could be funny, it could be true, or both.
You want your website to have none of the time wasting meaningless dribble that consumes so
many other websites that are much more concerned with themselves, than the customer. The
highest and best use of a website is to serve their visitors.

So how is this website going to serve its visitors? In this instance, it is to share with them a
very unique product that has never been for sale before and solves a few problems. You decide to


go over a list of the problems it solves before choosing the language you will use to encapsulate
the solutions. You must first visit the negative frame to invert it, and focus on the positive. It’s
actually also useful to use positive and negative space, as it is to use rewards and punishments,
there’s really no reason to limit yourself to just pulling or pushing when you can do both.
(Sometimes negative space poisons the experience, so try to have someone else lose those cool
points, while keeping the good ones, if possible, it’s an art.)
Problems to be solved: Our phones, computers, and electrical gadgets have never been more
important to us. The one thing all these gadgets have in common is that they need electricity.
Thus there’s always a question of how do you get the power from the wall into the devices you
love?

### Jealousy

It’s much easier to dream of a nice future when you see other people living your dream. What
an easy shortcut to consensus on a viable path. Well, at least more viable than any other known
way, might still be impossible for you personally if you’re a 4-foot tall guy who wants to play in
the NBA.

### Make Scalable Things into Kits

Make things scalable, make them into kits. Little problems that you spend lots of time on, like
customizing a car, end up taking just as much time and failing much harder than almost anything
having to do with business, so just do the business and buy a better car.

### Cheaply and Quickly Testing if Your Business Idea Will Work

You should try advertising whatever you plan to sell, without actually stocking it. You can
say that you just sold out, or you can say that you were just testing. If you can’t get people to call
the ad, what’s the use of having the product at all?

### Ramp Up

Focus on creating a design that human resources can advance without you. You don’t have to
be hard on yourself because you don’t actually matter. What matters is the design. If you’ve got


enough money to get a head start, set the right design and have the right human resources. You
could do a terrible job and waste your life away, but the thing you create will do a great job and
perhaps those people that you hired and that you control, they’re going to do a great job no
matter what you do. Then, despite yourself, no matter how bad you mess things up, your
employees are still going to do good work because there’s people out there that just exist that
way; some people just kick ass because it’s what they do.

### The Term “Startups”

“Startup” is a misnomer, a useless description of companies. If you are going to use words to
describe things so that you know the difference between one thing and another thing, which is
why everything doesn’t have the same name, then you might as well stop calling businesses
startups. This is because the important component of the endeavor is what they are out to do, not
how old they are.
That would be like calling McDonald’s “that 50 year old company.” No one cares how old or
new your company is, we care about what you are doing. Let’s stop calling all damn startups,
startups. Let’s refer to them as to what they are actually trying to do, and stop focusing on their
age. Or maybe, if you wanted to, you could use their user account or some other metric that is
actually useful. There’s not a great deal of similarity between a company that’s got a hundred
thousand customers and is only 6 months old being called a startup, and some dumb idea that
you had in your basement about selling lemonade at a cardboard stand in your front yard also a
startup. Calling both of those things the same thing kind of breaks the usefulness long term,
which was not useful to start with.
When you launch a start-up, there’s a very good chance that you’re not going to make a
positive impact in the world, because you’re going to run out of money.
Lots of people come up to you and say, “Hey, I’ve got a really great idea, but I’m afraid to
tell it to you because I’m afraid that, you know, you might do it.” And then you say, as Seth
Goldin does and lots of other respected authors in the business world will do, is tell them that
ideas are actually quite affordable. As a matter of fact, ideas are just about the least costly part of
any business. You’ll see lots and lots of great businesses with great ideas fail because in fact the
hard and expensive part is cutting the wheat from the chaff. In addition, some of the best
products that you’ll find in the world that are well executed were not what they started out as.


For instance, Flickr was originally a video game company. They accidentally became a photo
sharing company; a good photo sharing company. Facebook was once meant to be just a way for
people to talk to their friends at Harvard. Then it became a status symbol.
From Wikipedia: “Facebook is a social networking service launched in February 4, 2004. It
was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University
student Eduardo Saverin. The website’s membership was initially limited by the founders to
Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and
gradually most universities in Canada and the United States, corporations, and by September
2006, to everyone of age 13 and older with a valid (Harvard) email address.”
They wanted people to be able to get an address there, and they thought that that was their
value preposition. “Hey, look, your friends will kind of think that you’re at this exclusive
college.” And then it turned out that no one cared about that, and they cared more about all the
other things the website offered.
Slack, a multibillion-dollar company, became a chat and collaboration app, but originally
they were supposed to be something entirely different. I can’t remember right now, but they just
built that app in-house to manage the stuff they were doing.
And 37 Signals I believe started the same way. They just needed something in-house and
they did what they needed.
XX – Fact check the above references and cite them properly
That story has happened over and over and over again where execution is so good that the
idea you didn’t have originally is what makes you all your money, all your success and makes
everyone happy and gets you all the clients. The thing you weren’t thinking of, which you
thought would not work well, the side thing, is what actually got attention from the masses. The
thing that you thought was awesome, the thing that you got funding for, the thing that you
worked so hard for, failed and disappeared. Only because you were able to execute great on this
other idea by making a smart pivot move are you now able to make billions of dollars.

### Cut out the Middlemen

If a matchmaker introduced a man and woman for pair bonding and said, “So I’m going to
need you both to have sex with me 10 percent of the time you have sex with each other, because
I helped the deal happen, that’s my cut.” This is an example of how middlemen use scum tactics.


Dad, son, and Facebook.
Son tells Facebook, come see my soccer match.
Facebook tells dad. They’re all at the same table. Dad then tells Facebook “ok”, then
Facebook tells son “ok”, and also mentions that he might want to buy some soccer shoes.
This is the world we live in.

### Scaling

Scaling is easier when code does the work for you.
Part of the reason that doing a software business is so much better than any hardware
business, if effective, is because the amount of good that you can do for others isn’t restricted by
them having to buy, have shipped, store, and perhaps charge for a physical thing. Their life can
be affected in a beneficial way at nearly zero cost per extra user.
That’s why if you can find ways to help people digitally, or through information, it’s much
easier to help more people.

#### Remember This Principle

It’s easier to make money by affecting millions of people a little bit rather than a few people
a whole lot. It’s basically the limiting factor of how much you can positively affect someone’s
life. Even if you meant the “whole world” to a person, how could that person’s whole world
possibly compare in value to a small piece of “world” but from 1 billion people? No matter how
much you could do for a single person, you’d find it hard to not make more of an impact no
matter how individually small times 1 billion people.

## Focus on Profit

Leave the less impactful things outside, just bring in the profit. Try to do the things that are
worth doing and not all the things you could do, but aren’t really worth much. The 80/20 rule
makes it so that 80 percent of your problems come from 20 percent of your customers, and 80
percent of your profit comes from 20 percent of your products, etc., so by focusing on the good
stuff, and getting rid of the bad, you can do great things.
Chew and swallow before you take your next bite.


Imagine that you start 100 businesses, and you spend all your time shopping for 100 locations
for them to exist, and building 100 logos, etc.
It’s likely you will end up with zero businesses.
Instead, let’s imagine you just start one business, do whatever you need to do to get it up and
running, and doing well, and then you go on to business two. It’s much smarter to start a thing
and finish the thing so that it can be making you money in the background while you start the
next thing, than it is to half start 10 things, and watch all of them fail. Or really even worse, they
never fail, because you think that they are all in progress, while in reality they’re all
progressively and slowly failing despite your ongoing effort. Ten chefs going into the kitchen
and blowing hot air on a steak isn’t going to do as well a job cooking it as one chef putting it on
the grill.

### Let Your Customer Know You Love Them

Your customer sales processor should be more like a red carpet than a funnel, because red
carpet is affordable these days right?
Evil business / Dark patterns
Employees
Hire the right people
Peter Thiel has cool points
Do you have to be devoid of empathy to break out of groupthink and find a profitable
monopoly for yourself? (Not caring about what others thinks allows you to work longer, harder,
and on things no one else would care to.)

### The Myth of the 10x Developer

A “10x developer” is an individual who is thought to be as productive as 10 others in his or
her field. The 10x developer can produce 10 times the outcomes of other colleagues, in a
production, engineering, or software design environment.
Some things are so hard that you can either do them or not, you can’t half do them. This is
where l 0 x developers actually exist. Some things are incremental, like data entry. It’s very hard
to find someone that can speak or type 10 times faster than someone else. Thus, sometimes l 0 x


developers seem to exist, because they can do the thing that others can’t, 0 or 1, binary. And
sometimes that same developer isn’t l 0 x at all, because the project doesn’t support the
complexity required to stop others from performing, and thus allowing one to achieve a l 0 x
status. Thus, if it’s not complex, you’re not going to have l 0 x.
If it is complex, some people will never be able to do it at all, and in that case, they’re really
infinite x developers because that’s the difference between something existing and not, right?
For instance, let’s say you need to bench press 500 lbs. Well, you either can, or you can’t,
there’s really no half way doing it, right? So is it fair to say that the person that can bench 500
lbs. is l 0 x the person that can bench only 50? Nope, not if you only care about the 500 lb. It’s
binary. The 50 lb. bench guy isn’t useful for this task.
In Summary, l 0 x is misleading, it’s often all or nothing. Complexity allows l 0 x to exist
sometimes. It is the thing being worked on that decides whether you can be a l 0 x performer or
not. Before you look for a l 0 x person, ask, is this a thing that actually can be multiplied tenfold?

#### Humans Are Far Less Reliable Than Machines

To sell more boxes, you need barely any new infrastructure. Maybe more space, maybe more
shelves. You want to do 10 times more house calls, or service of whatever sort? You need about
10 times the people, and 10 times the vehicles. And then you’ve got lots of people that work for
you. They get sick, they steal, they compete against you, and they make a union to get the most
pay possible. Now you have 10x the problems! They don’t aim when they pee. Depending on
where you live, you might not be allowed to fire them. They might get pregnant and leave, and
you can pay them for the next year while they take care of their newborn. Lucky you!
If business doesn’t go so well and you can’t keep everyone, you have to let some go, you
come off as terrible. You find people that will do the same or better work for the same or less
money, and you want to switch to them? DAMN YOU! How dare you allow competition!
Being an employer is not all that it’s cracked up to be. And it’s worse than that. You will feel
great stress as a nice employer, feeling it’s your lot in life never fire anyone, and never give
anyone a pay cut. And that social stress of being responsible for so many friendly faces should be
more stress than any purely financial stress should be. Money rarely calls you a bastard to your
face, or behind your back. Money also rarely punches you in the face.


Take a look at the richest people in the world. How many of them make products, and how
many make services? Barring amazing gifts of ability in performing services, always choose
products!

### More Challenges

#### Non-Compete Agreements

Non-compete agreements are basically like door locks. They’re just there to keep honest
people honest. Like door locks, they don’t stop anyone actually motivated to break the law.

#### Hackathons

It’s curious that you can, for $10,000, get 150 people to create something in competition for
it. It literally means that you got 150 people to do something for $67 dollars each. Yep, hard to
believe it, but $67 dollars times 150 people is $10,000 dollars. Wow.

#### Detecting Leeches

Forced vacations are nice because you can tell who’s actually important, and who’s just a
pretender. If they go on vacation and no one even notices, they very well may be a leech.
Just like you’re not always doing what you should do, I assure you, neither are your
employees. If you happen to be in the tech business and you have the bandwidth, you might find
it useful to just screen share their screens on your screen. If you have a 4k screen you can look at
4 full resolution 192x1080 screens. You can probably detect them messing around at a
compressed resolution, depending on how large an area their messing around is taking up.
You could also use a program like ManicTime to track what files, websites, and programs
they’re actually spending time on.
If you have enough employees, looking over their shoulders should be a full time job, unless
it’s a hard to measure thing, like software, in wish case you may not be able to detect good
things, but you could detect bad things, like Facebook, or Reddit.

#### Minimum Management


When you don’t have to manage other people, you don’t think work is getting done when
you’re not doing it. You’re more likely to start doing shit once you lose your employees, because
you’re messing around becomes infinitely more obvious. When you are “busy” managing other
people, you’re not personally doing work to get the project done. It’s even likely that the increase
in performance you get out of the other people by managing them is less than you would just
letting them be mediocre and working alongside them. This ratio changes the more people you
are able to influence. The smaller the team, the more you should just work hard and let them
mess up.

### Money Is Good to Have

More money = less risk. Better environment = more opportunities.
The compounding effect says that if you live in a better neighborhood, you have better
friends, and you’re more likely to make more money. If you make more money, you can have
better healthcare and a car that avoids getting into accidents with other people. Go on YouTube
and search for the “Tesla auto collision avoidance system” or other manufacturers, you’ll see
accidents that definitely would have happened but didn’t, because they had enough money to
have an anti-collision system in their car, and if you don’t have the money for that, then you are
going to have more risk in your life.
The more money you have, the more time you have. The healthier you could be, the healthier
you can eat, and the smarter your friends are, the more opportunities that show up. Where some
people will die by getting the wrong treatment, you’ll get the right treatment, and where some
people will die by getting into a car accident, you may not because your car can save you. As a
matter of fact, you could have so much money that you don’t have to drive anymore. Or you
could ride in a bus that’s so big that the world could run into you and you wouldn’t notice,
because the momentum of your vehicle causes everyone else to be pushed aside.

### Family Businesses

Lots of people grow up working for the family business. One could imagine lots of them get
paid hourly. Paying your family members to work seems to be all right.


The chance that you have a family business where your employees can actually grow is pretty
slim. It is more likely they’ll just leave you when they can.

### Negotiating

What is the least you’ll take? (Buying something). What would have to happen to convince
you of this? If you can’t get a good pre-question answer, you won’t get a good real question
answer. If you can’t hold hands with the girl, you can’t kiss the girl. If you can’t get into a
conversation with the girl, you can’t hold hands.
Hoop theory: two small hoops, one large hoop. This is like the Benjamin Franklin strategy
that if a person does one thing for you, it’s easier to get them to do more things for you. “What’s
the least you will take?”
“If I do X, Y, and Z, will you do M right now?” No commitment, then you don’t do X, Y, or
Z. If I can get you a discount on this model, and get you the red color, will you buy the car right
now? If I pay you cash, and buy right now, can I get a 20 percent discount? If they fail the pre-
test hoop, then you haven’t just given away margin for nothing. It’s like security at the credit
card company.
They don’t care what you have, they just want you to have more, they want to feel like they
broke your balls a bit to prove who you are. So any information you volunteer without them
asking is just wasting the finite amount of data you have to offer, and wasting time. Hell, you’re
probably messing up their script as well. Lots of lower paid people don’t work so well off-script.

### Leadership

There are a lot of people in this world who have employees, and some of them haven’t
learned to lead through example. They’re paying a great privilege to have employees and instead
of becoming better men themselves and getting more performance out of their employees,
they’re shittier men themselves. And so, not only do they get less from their own weak
performance because they don’t feel obligated to perform and lead, be honorable and respected
through positive behavior and output, and so they lose twice.
They lose once by being terrible workers and they lose again when their employees notice
how bad they are and end up doing less as well. Winners lead by example and are honorable and


bring their “A” game. The ones who win get all the benefits from themselves, which may exceed
what the employees can generate. It may depend on how many employees are working and
whether they are being allocated properly, and if the employees are driven to excellence. You
cannot find too many examples of successful teams or successful companies who have nothing
good going for them. Maybe they exist, but they’re probably the exception rather than the rule.

### Recognizing a Good Business

To know all those things, that’s actually specialized knowledge. Unless you’ve been trained in
it, or are otherwise a very gifted and lucky person, you probably don’t know what makes a good
business a good business.
Even if someone gave you an amazing profitable idea with a high likelihood of working, you
still wouldn’t do it. Your super special, super amazing ideas that you think are so good and worth
so much money are probably actually not, because you don’t know what making a lot of money
looks like unless you’ve done it a couple times. There are people who are qualified to know the
difference between a good business and a bad business, and you may or may not be one of them.
Just because you had the idea doesn’t mean that loads of other intelligent people all over the
planet didn’t come up with that same idea and patent it before you. If you invented it on your
own, it doesn’t matter because so did lots of other people. While we’re talking about
simultaneous invention, guess how many times the super important, super awesome eye ball has
been invented in different creatures on completely different paths. Thirty, forty, fifty times?
It’s something that’s so important and so useful that if we all died off and there was nothing
left here, but the chance of life occurring again with near certainty. If earth was similar in
environment, then eyes would be created yet again because they work well.

### Idea Profitability...................................................................................................................

If you want to know how sticky your idea is, you can just look at the profitability of your
idea. The reason some things aren’t profitable is because people don’t want them to be. People
vote with their dollars. If your ideas are terrible, people will let you know by not buying it.
Whereas you might like to dream that the non-profit oriented, more charitable idea is the better
idea, actually what you’re doing is you’re just cutting off the voting ability of the people on the


other side of the transaction. If you did charge a price, that price that you’re charging is the
ability for people to vote. That’s their ballots that they got to tell you whether what you have is
good or bad.
If you’re interested in serving the customer, if you’re interested in serving the world, then
you should give them the ability to tell you what they think by buying or not buying your thing.
If you don’t give them the ability to vote with their dollars, then you’ve never truly asked them
whether what you’re doing is liable or not. This is because the only reliable answer that you can
use to know whether what you’re doing is truly valuable to someone else or not, is to ask them to
answer you in cold hard cash.

### Hire Non-Distracting People

Hire non-attractive if you can. Beautiful people absorb the time and consciousness of
everyone near them, either actively trying to become romantic, or actively trying to not think
about it. That’s the definition of attraction. It’s not a choice. Obviously, if you’re hiring booth
girls, or outside sales reps, actors, etc., then you will need to have some beautiful people on
board. If you’re working in an office though, it’s very likely you will do better with uglier
people, at least from a distraction perspective.
Now, on the recruiting angle however, you might have some challenges attracting new talent
if your office looks like a zoo of human oddity. You could also try hiring all of a single gender,
but that would not go over well with the Social Justice Warriors.

#### Use Beautiful People to Face the Public

Harness the power of beautiful people for your endeavors. Making a TV show? Fill every
single role up with unrealistically beautiful people. Attraction is not a choice, we will tune in.
Every time someone visits your store, or sees your marketing, if you don’t have a beautiful face
on it, you’ve missed an opportunity to trigger an easy to get attraction response. We love beauty,
give us what we love.

### Reasons Why You Should Think Big


You may have yet to discover that when you are courting a beautiful woman, the amount of
time and effort that goes into cute text messages, dressing nicely, going out on dates and such is
exactly the same whether that girl is a 10 or a 5 on a scale from 1-10. Then why not aim for the
10’s? It’s their job to shoot you down, not yours. Go in there, take your licks like a man, and try
to make it work. As they say, if you shoot for the stars you very well may hit the moon. The
interesting part of this discovery is that it applies to business even more adeptly than it does to
love.
The time and effort that you put into a business that has small growth potentials is identical to
the time you put into a business that has billions of dollars of potential. In either business you’re
likely to think about it and pay attention to news regarding it in your free time. When you’re not
in your free time, you’ll likely be doing the 8-14 hour days that business people who want to be
successful often put in. Why spend your time in a business with 10 to 1 million times less
potential? How can you tell how much potential your business really has?
A good metric some like to look at is, how many lives can you affect? Is someone else
already doing this for free? For example, let’s say that you wanted to create a store to compete
with Walmart. Hmm, how will you out compete them? Better selection? Better price? They
maybe work on a 3 percent margin? They have the lowest costs from their suppliers. It’s really
useful to compare the exponential growth side of sales to the linear cost savings side. One can go
up really high and the other can move very far.

### Progress, Not Disruption

Disrupt sounds like disruptor in a Star Trek movie. It’s not something you do to a business.
When the giant banks came and ate up all the little banks giving you the maximum risk with the
minimum choice, that was disruption. War is disruption. Disruption isn’t a noble goal. It’s the
difference between change and progress. What you want is not disruption, but progress.
There are whole business conferences literally called “disrupt” because they love to see
things “disrupted” because they think it’s very profitable to be “disruptive” to the existing
companies in a “space” who are making lots of money.
First, shareholders in businesses are a minority of humans, not a majority. The only people
who love the disruption are the people that are in the minority that stand to benefit massively
financially from it, or perhaps anarchists in general.


Change isn’t what we need, progress is.
Disruption isn’t what we need, progress is.
If you consider a massively successful “disruptive” industry like casual gaming on your phone
(which destroys thousands of years of useful human conscious ability every year) it should be a
warning, not an example. Its profit is not a marker of how much better it has made the world, but
of how much life it has wasted. So basically, disruption is often anti productive. If you focus on
disruption, you are taking what already is and inverting it. You are not inventing what doesn’t
exist yet. When you use what already exists as a starting point to calculate the next thing that you
will do, then you already have blinders on that will limit your creativity. You don’t need a better
game, you need a way to gamify things that actually help mankind. You don’t need a way to
make long distance phone calls cheaper on land lines, you need to stop having land lines. That
type of thinking.

### Make Your Customers’ Lives Easier

Look past the sale. What common behaviors do your customers have to perform after they
buy from you? Do they have to buy other parts? Do they need installation? Do they have to track
shipments? What about before the sale? Are there special tools? Do they have questions that
must be answered? Why force them to become experts, and know more about the business than
you do? Why don’t you do the experimenting and science for them? So few people do this that
you can actually make it your brand.
You know what your overseas B2B customers have to do when they buy from you—track
shipments, and pay customs, etc. Why don’t you pull the tracking data off the shipping vendor
for them, so they don’t have to figure out two websites and can just visit yours? Then you can
scrape the data to see if one of your mail carriers is slow or losing packages, and they have a
reason to come to your website more often. If you give them the tracking number and want them
to use it on the shipper’s website, why would they come back to your site and see your cool new
products? Foot traffic and eyeballs are valuable.

#### Do Your Own Unboxing Videos......................................................................................

You spend millions on packaging material and design, but if someone wants to see an
unboxing video, they have to go to some garage video YouTuber. Why don’t you pay for your


own professional unboxing videos? Why don’t you do your own reviews as a giant corporation?
You see how popular they are, right? The end users care more about the unboxing and review
videos than any of the sad marketing fluff bullshit on your websites! Stop looking inwards and
get in uptime. Know what your customers should want before they do. Know more about your
product than they do. Do all the post-sale stuff for them instead of relying on amateurs to do it
for you. Perhaps in the process you will even learn more about what you are making and selling,
so that your next version can be better.

#### Multitier Usage of People in Markets

Why don’t we see more multitier usage of people in markets? “Hey, you know someone that
has this, you get an x finder’s fee.” Or, “Hey I’m looking for this, I’ll pay this, and throw you x
dollars for the introduction.” You could look at it like TCP / IP syn / ack overhead. It’s a low
price to pay for finding and being able to transact on what you are looking for.
Google is an affiliate, an information middleman.
Look how much money Google makes serving this exact purpose. They’re a giant middleman
to the world’s information. They generate no content worth reading compared to what they
index. Look how much money they make.

#### Generous Return Policy Boosts Sales

Overall, lenient return policies led to increased purchases, the study found.

Return-Policies-on-C_story-wide.html?WT.mc_id=NewsEmail>

### Expanding Your Business Up and Down

It’s easier to build down the stack than it is to build it up, because you’re already a customer
of what is below you. You have an engineering and product scope problem going up the stack,
you’re not as qualified to know what the customers want up there.
More at: [http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/18/why-big-companies-keep-failing-the-stack-](http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/18/why-big-companies-keep-failing-the-stack-)
fallacy/

#### Bidding Tactics


You can offer 20 percent over anyone else’s offer, and if there’s any other action, why
wouldn’t they come to you? If the other people’s offers are too high, you can just say so, you’re
not morally bound to get super screwed. Or you could include the language, with a reason. Some
people like the language, “I’ll give you 30 percent over anyone else’s highest real offer.” This
works for items that you really want, and don’t actually cost that much. However, most other
people, for whatever reason, just aren’t willing to pay that much for them. You could use this
strategy if you have more money than the average bidder, or you could reduce the amount of the
other bids you are willing to pay. For instance, you might say only 10 percent, and they could
still be happy with it.
Why would you ever bid early? Always bid at the last minute.

### Stacking Failure Modes and Duals Points of Failure

You hear people say good things about doing a startup in an industry that’s risky, and saying
that it’s like leverage, you’re getting an option on an option. Those people are likely incorrect.
What you’re actually getting is dual points of failure, either which of which drives the other to
zero. You’re not getting an option on an option, you’re getting basically something that sucks
multiplied by something else that sucks. Let’s do the math. You just buy stock in an index, so the
underlying thing, it goes up, you win. You buy stock in a company that invests in the thing.
Company goes to zero, you go to zero. The thing that the company is dealing with goes to zero,
you go to zero.
Would you rather have two chances to go to zero that multiply by each other? Either one of
them goes to zero, you’re out, or would you rather just have a single failure mode? Stacking
failure modes on top of your idea doesn’t give you more leverage, it gives you more failure.
If you want proof of that concept, consider start-ups in the Bitcoin space versus Bitcoin itself.
Which one’s doing better? No start-ups are doing even bearably good, while the project itself is
doing fine.

### Understanding Is Expensive

We didn’t need to understand how horses worked internally to build the car. You don’t need
to understand how cancer works internally to find it and destroy it. The solutions to many


problems are found by not looking or caring about how or why the problem exists, but just
focusing on what you want, and getting that, not focusing on what you don’t want. Would you
rather analyze and understand why your room is messy, or would you rather just clean it? Not
only does it cost too much, it also limits your creativity, putting blinders on you.

### Hunt Down Manufacturers

Dealing with retailers and worrying about their stock is almost nearly always more stupid than
finding the root, the manufacturer, rather than hunting your distributors down. Calling all them to
see which retailers have a thing, then you know you didn’t miss any products.

### The Markets: Easy to Lose

The markets are where you go to make a small fortune out of a large fortune.
If a guy is looking at screens all day long, guessing will it go up or will it go down, how does
this make the world a better place?
The people that lose in the market get to go back to work, it’s basically a battle for who has to
work, and who doesn’t.
When you think people are long or short, it can be the other way, because it reversed
depending on whether they have already placed their trade or not. Did you ever notice that
Berkshire Hathaway is always entering or exiting, and never really done with the position?
That’s because they enter the trades intelligently.

## Selling

### Showing Up in Searches

When you name files, spam them with the words you will be using to find that file later, or
don’t be surprised if you never find it again. Do the same for your ads and when you look for
things. Keycap and keycaps and key cap, and key top, and keyset all give you different results,
but what you’re looking for is the same damn thing. Expanding your saving tags and searching
tags. The larger sites out there should do this work for your customers. Why do they have to be


thesaurus experts when you can tell that smart shoppers search common terms one after the other
to land at the same ads? This can be done algorithmically surely, or by human.
Make sure your business and website don’t have homonyms, or you will have to spell it out
every single time you tell someone about it, if you’re even lucky enough for them to know to
ask.

### Shopping Carts

If you only have one item, why do you have a “cart” for shopping?
Visualizing what you’ve got for sale. Perhaps let people see things in spreadsheet form in
multiple orders and styles?

### Analysis Paralysis

Analysis paralysis is real, if they don’t know what they’re buying is the right thing you offer,
they won’t buy. This is why more products can be worse. Just like more payment methods can be
worse.

### Halo Experiences

We live in a world of 4k screens, yet no matter what site you expand on your screen, it still
wants to pretend you’re on a cellphone, pretty much. Just like companies produce halo and
concept products to lend value to all the other products in their lineups, so too should websites
offer a halo experience, which would lend value to all the other inferior, smaller experiences they
offer on mobile sites. People are trying to spend money on your sites, why does one have to click
“next” 40 times, and see only four columns at once? Why is the search feature so deficient? Why
do customers have to search four different regional sites, and beat up on your options to actually
see all of what they can purchase? Amazon’s search is so bad that people are actually building
their own external searches to make the experience better.

### Marketing

In sales you can offer someone a lie that has monetary value to them. You can tell them that
something is the last one you have, when it’s really not. You could also say that the item was


priced wrong, and that the sales rep will get in trouble if you buy it, and it will also increase the
value of the product in their eyes at the cost of a single lie, and some reputation, and you could
say, your moral soul.

### Clickbait

```
http://minimaxir.com/2015/01/linkbait/
```
### Discounts: You’re Probably Getting Screwed

Next time you’re offered any kind of discount or bargain, you have to assume the odds are not
in your favor, because the person making the bargain or discounts or offeror’s job to get the
maximum amount of profitable dollars out of you. And thus, unless some odd mistake has been
made by that person and he will actually end up getting less dollars - you are going to end up
getting screwed.

#### MyPillow Condemned for Fake “Discounts”

In 2017, based on a pattern of complaints by consumers, the Better Business Bureau (BBB)
revoked the accreditation of Minnesota-based MyPillow, lowering its rating to an F. The BBB


made the decision after reviewing MyPillow's ongoing “buy one get one free” offer, which
violates the organization's code of advertising.
“Among other issues, BBB has attempted to persuade MyPillow to discontinue their ‘buy one
get one free’ (BOGO)/other discount offers without success,” said Dana Badgerow, president
and CEO of BBB of Minnesota and North Dakota. “Continuous BOGO offers, which can then be
construed as an item’s regular, everyday price, violate not only BBB’s Code of Advertising -
which all BBB Accredited Businesses agree to abide by - but also other state and national
organizations’ rules.”

#### Secret Discount Network

Having a secret discount network that unionized and gave the purchasing class some type of
competition against the price-fixing retailer distribution networks that force retailers to screw
you over with high prices, one might think that the secrets that they keep regarding their costs
should be cancelled out by the secrets that we keep regarding the discounts we give.

#### Marketing Serpentine

Avoid the marketing serpentine in all stores (they route you like a sheep, a stupid shopping
sheep that dispenses money).

#### Self-Help Business

The self-help industry is based on you estimating what your future is worth, thinking someone
is going to help you get there, and then paying that person a percentage of it up front, while I do
nothing for the good luck that you might happen to stumble upon.

#### Overpriced Clarity.fm

Clarity.fm is a marketplace claiming to offer one-on-one expert advice on a wide variety of
business topics. The site makes it easy to facilitate quick Q&A-style consulting calls.
Set up extremely overpriced Clarity.fm account to establish value by proxy. Spam search
results on Linkedin to establish value by proxy. If you set yourself an account as an expert and
you put your price high, it makes you seem valuable.


### Benefits of Marketing

So is it solvable? Yes. Should someone solve it? Yes. It shouldn’t work for more than just
promoting Bitcoin. But it’s easier to do that because people see financial gain. Such as, put in
0.5% of your holdings, do this marketing campaign, watch the new money come in, and see your
wealth grow. You could even sell into the new money and make back your $5,000 and roll it
again, and roll it again, and roll it again. And that’s how marketing works. Your lifetime value of
customer exceeds your cost of acquisition, and you’re rolling in the dough.
If searched for, many of the habits and inclinations we have can probably be traced to a
hardcore marketing campaign.

### Patents: File and Forget

How to file a patent, fire and forget, you will spend more time researching if a patent already
exists than paying your fee and letting the examiners do their jobs, which is to find out if it
already exists. Also, the more searching you do and the more you learn, the more risk you have
because you are legally required to disclose anything you knew about that was relevant, and the
situation could quite easily exist where you disagree on the relevance of a thing, and now you are
legally liable for breaking the law. If you didn’t over search, you wouldn’t be breaking the law.
Now, there might be some minimum search that is required, in which case if such a thing did
exist one would suggest you meet that expectation within a comfortable margin and not exceed
it, unless you are short on cash.

### Selling Your Business

Selling to greater fools can be better than selling to wizards. The wizards aren’t likely to get a
bad deal, so if they want to buy, perhaps you shouldn’t be selling.

If great investors want to buy your business, perhaps you shouldn’t sell. If Warren Buffett
wants to buy your business, you have to think to yourself, “I’m basically taking the most
opposite position on a transaction against a person who is known to make better decisions in this
area. Is that really what I want to do?” Perhaps you prefer freedom more than money, maybe, but
if you’re selling for the money you’re better off feeling good about the trade when the person on


the other side of it is an idiot, than when the person on the other side makes you look like an idiot
in comparison.

## Scams

The funny thing about being scammed is that if you don’t have much money, you can’t be
scammed for much money. If you do have lots of money, it’s likely that you are able to make
lots of money, and therefore if you are scammed, you can recover and go back to having lots of
money.
Scams are kind of self-regulated against being too gigantic to the individuals they are
perpetrated against. There are some pretty tragic non-monetary side effects, like taking up all of
your making money energy trying to recover that which was lost. The disenchantment with the
overall dog-eat-dog nature of many people’s actions and identities.
For some people the self-regulation doesn’t count, they lose their life savings in a single
swoop and don’t have enough life left in them to be made whole again. People whose families
depended on them and they find themselves out in the streets.
If you want to avoid being scammed, it helps to know what scams look like. And it helps to
see all the advanced fee fraud scams that exist. “My wife lost her ring here, or a watch here, or a
valuable thing here. I have to go, so just give me this small amount and she’ll come back and get
it later.” Right; this is an obvious scam, don’t pay them anything. There’s a couple websites that
just deal in calling out scammers, and they’ve literally categorized all the different kinds of
scams. Be knowledgeable about the many ways to be scammed.
Scivive would say you should focus more on being productive than you should focus on
being not scammed. The useful advice is reversed the older you become, or if the one-time
nature your current wealth is the result of, perhaps a court settlement, divorce, or sale of a
company you have a non-compete with, or you’re just older than you are young. If you currently
have much more than you’d ever be able to make back, definitely focus more on protecting what
you have than trying to grow it.
One day the poor staff will have to do a literal song and dance to get you to buy some new
leggings or whatever the sale of the week is. I’m pretty tired of seeing scams in the inflight
magazine. This week it was a $300 LED light. Really, a piece of plastic with some green and


yellow LEDs in it, three hundred dollars. Says it was tested, clinically. There’s a star next to the
clinically that says tested on 30 volunteers. Wow. Then you’ve got all these bracelets with a
magnet in them, three hundred dollars. Says it helps you sleep, and feel better, and focus, and
whatever else you need to hear to pay $300 for a $13 item.
It makes you wonder whether misleading advertisements and the money it parts people with
are justified the same way that people justify the lottery. It is quite literally a tax on people that
can’t do math, and it ruins literally the lives of nearly all that win it. But it somehow perseveres.
Perhaps we feel better thinking that someone was going to part the stupid with their money, so it
might as well be for a cause that is kind of good.
It is pretty mind boggling, the mental gymnastics people will do to justify evil things which
only profit them. For instance, taking money from people that are too stupid to keep it, makes
them have to work harder, and through their hard work, they likely make the world a better
place. Hell, that’s not even very gymnastically inclined, though it might actually be accurate in
some cases. One could assume there will be edge cases where someone is literally already
working to capacity, or wouldn’t be able to afford better production precursors or equipment.
Scivive argues that in an ideal world, whatever marketing and leverage and incentives you
can use to make the world a better place will probably make the world a better place. If you think
playing the lottery is bad for you, and it’s bad for everyone else, then we probably shouldn’t be
marketing it with state funds on television. Perhaps an advertisement for eating healthy, which, if
effective, would lead to reductions in health care spending for the state and increases in
happiness and healthiness. It wouldn’t be surprising if more fit people led to more children being
born, because fit people are attractive, and being attractive can cause attraction, which causes
proximity, which causes love and all the nice tricycle motors that go with it.

### Most of What Is Advertised to You Is a Scam.....................................................................

In the world of competition for your eyeballs, the people that give you the best deal can’t
afford to be seen, and the people that screw you the hardest can afford to pay for your attention.
Hedge funds weren’t even allowed to advertise to you until 2013, but the scams have always
found a way.
If it reached out to you, more than you reached out to it, then it’s more likely to be a scam,
and there’s an art to making you believe that you, and not they, did the reaching out.


There’s a fool at every table—and if you don’t know who that fool is, then you’re the fool.
When you’re betting, buying, or selling, or even working with other people it really helps to
know who the fool is.

### Don’t Get Robbed

One of the better things that can come out of this digitized world is better cooperation. Now if
you let someone rob you, you have not only turned them into a bigger crook, because you
offered them such great profit. You also lost money and a friend, or money and a relationship.
Now you have also sent a pointer that anyone else that wants to make money has that as a
behavior that they can do. It’s just all around bad.

#### Pyramid Schemes

Don’t fall for MLMs (multi-level-marketing schemes), get =-rich-quick schemes, or Ponzi
schemes, or any of the other stupid schemes. Buying jewelry and speakers from the backs of
trucks and in parking lots, people do both of these things all the time. The speakers are never
good, and the gold usually turns out to be fake. MLMs are the maximum amount of middlemen
and the minimum amount of useful employees.
If you’ve heard of an item, but for some reason you can’t buy it in any stores, even though
it’s not expensive, then you are likely looking at a pyramid scheme, or a niche item. Items that
are affordable and useful, find their way onto shelves in normal stores, just like soap, and bread.
They’re not hard to find, and they have the minimum number of middlemen. No one will spend
time convincing you to come to their bread sales hype seminar, to buy your bread reseller
package, because it’s already an efficient market, all you would be doing is jacking up prices to
the end users, and getting in between them and the manufacturers.

### Get the Best Work Done

If minions do all the work on your account, only minion quality labor will appear. Why not
hire the minion in house, and save the middleman fee his boss is charging?
If they make more money when you have a problem, they are more likely to subconsciously,
or purposely allow problems to occur for you, that you can pay them to fix. This is true of the up


sellers of the auto mechanic franchises. You may go in for an oil change, and they “discover” ten
other issues that need to be repaired. You leave with a receipt of worthless labor totaling a few
hundred dollars or more.

#### Real Estate Agents

As another example, real estate agents make more money the higher price the house sells for.
Why would a real estate agent want to make less on the deal by getting you a better price, for the
chance you establish a long term business relationship and purchase other houses to become a
repeat client? How many houses are you buying anyway? Real estate agents should be obsolete
by now.

#### Lawyers

Lawyers love troublesome clients; the more trouble you get in, the more money they make.
Lawyers are people to whom you give your fortune in order to prevent someone else from
getting it. You could say that their business is based on people trying to counter unlawful or
immoral thievery.

#### Accountants

Accountants—their first mission is to cover their ass, then maybe save you money, maybe.
One may sometimes find dark patterns in their tactics. Giving money back to the client
guarantees retention of the client. If the accountant runs into some unexplained good fortune,
such as a shiny new Mercedes, he or she might claim that the income came from other
investments.

### The Tragedy of Scammers and Conmen

Scammers are often charming, intelligent, motivated people. When their victims discover they
have been scammed, they’d like to get their money back if they can. If the inventive and
adventurous scammers spent less time figuring out new ways to victimize people, and put their
skills towards honest work, both they and their victims would find more profit in it. The first
thing you should care about when hiring someone is their honesty. Then their ability comes


second. If someone that worked with you wanted to steal from you, you prefer they be
ineffective. Thus ethics comes before ability.

### Scam Tactics

If you want to avoid being scammed, it helps to know what scams look like. And it helps to
see all the advanced fee fraud scams that exist.
Religion is one. Uh, this, what was the fraud you were describing?
Gas station – my wife lost her ring here, watch here, valuable thing here. I have to go. Just
give me this small amount and she’ll come back and get it later. Right. Uh, all of those scammy
things, they’re... the reason I know about them is because there’s a couple websites that just deal
in calling out scamsters, and they’ve literally categorized all the different kinds of scams.
Someone had to come up with a term for this whole thing of, “I’m going to promise you a lot
in the future, just give me this now. I’m going to promise you eternal life, just say a little bit of
prayers. I’m going to promise you eternal life and ecstasy that lasts forever, just don’t eat any
pork.” These promises could indicate that religion is a scam. Does that seem like a fair deal?
Would anyone not accept that? If that were reality and you get eternal life and you just have to
not eat pork, one would cut pork off the entire human menu.
But that’s the problem with advanced fee fraud—you don’t know anyone who’s ever gotten
the reward. They never come back and tell you about it. You never see video. You never hear
audio because it never happens. They want you to pay now thinking that you’re investing in your
future, but in reality the future you’re investing in is theirs and the future you’re sacrificing is
your own.

### Finding “Marks” and “Dupes”

Sometime what seems stupid is actually pretty smart.
Scam emails are written in terrible fashion, because they only want less intelligent people to
respond. They don’t have time to field timewaster phone calls, they evolved to be worse, in order
to scam better.
What people name their businesses tells you more about the person naming it than it does the
actual business strategy or product. Business names tell you more about what the person in


charge of the name had in their mind space than they tell you anything about the business. If you
are at a website that has the word millionaire in it, you for sure aren’t going to be talking to any
millionaires. Basically you’re just going to be scammed. Penny stocks, binary options, gold, FX,
Ponzi schemes, HYIP, you name it, it’s a scam.

#### Churches and Tithing

The hypocrisy of giving money to “God” (it really goes to the people running the church or
cult) and hoping he invests it for you, and gives you back more, because, you know, he needs
your money.
Church scams are just an advance-fee fraud, at least the ones that tell you you’ll make more
money in return if you send them money.

#### Don Lapre Suicide in Prison

Donald D. Lapre was an American multi-level marketing and infomercial salesman. His work
involved product packages such as “The Greatest Vitamin in the World” and “Making Money
Secrets.” Lapre was criticized for selling fraudulent business plans that did not work for his
clients.
In June 2011, A grand jury indicted Lapre in June on 41 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud,
wire fraud and promotional money laundering though his company, “The Greatest Vitamin in the
World.” The company’s “customers” spent nearly $51.8 million to sell vitamins and recruit
others to do the same. But only 5,000 people received about $6.4 million in commission,
according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Lapre reaped at least $2.2 million from
between 2004 to 2007, the department said.

#### Kevin Trudeau

Kevin Mark Trudeau was an American fraudster, author, salesman, and pool enthusiast,
known for promotion of his books and resulting legal cases involving the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC). His ubiquitous late-night infomercials, which promoted unsubstantiated
health, diet, and financial advice, earned him a fortune but eventually resulted in civil and
criminal penalties for fraud, larceny, and contempt of court.


In November 2013, Trudeau was convicted of criminal contempt, and was sentenced to 10
years in federal prison and a $37.6 million fine. He will be eligible for release in 2022.
There are many, many more just like them....

## Investing

Getting rich on low returns takes too long.
To get rich is a pretty stupid idea the way it’s normally suggested. You literally have to
continually, nearly forever, never take money out of your account and experience any of the real
world benefits of being rich (by being able to actually spend money on things you want), and
then one day, after your life is nearly over, you finally get to be rich, because you deprived
yourself so long. That’s not a good way to get rich at all! Live like a poor person forever, so you
can try to make compounding interest make up for your low rates of return.
There was once a guide on how to get rich that you could save money by foraging for food
and hunting. That’s a pretty funny suggestion to try and use if you live in a big city, because
you’d have to forage in garbage cans.

#### Business Beats Speculation

Why would you put 100k into Bitcoin, when you could put 100k into a business that could
capture even more value! If you speculate in Bitcoin you have to wait for it to go up. Let’s
phrase this in a better way for you. Ready?
If you create a business for 100k, and in the first year it generates 100k of revenue, and nets
30k after costs. You can sell that business for 3 times net easy, no problems at all. Why? Because
there is money out there that desperately needs a home, and if you can pay 99k (3 years of net)
and make literally 33 percent a year return on investment, then who would turn down a 33
percent per year return on investment? Banks offer what? Like 0 percent, or negative percent?
Make a business, any business, and you get to make all the future money that the business hasn’t
even made yet. This is the principle of making future money that doesn’t even exist yet.
You can make 10 years of money in 3 years, easy. If you look at the multiples that publicly
traded companies are looking at, you could maybe get a 20 times earnings exit.


Hence, you have two options: work, and work, and wait for the business to make the money,
and then you have your profit; or, you can sell it for money that it has never and may never even
make, and then go do it again, and again and again. So you could literally make 100’s of years of
business profit in few years. You can’t do that just by speculating.

#### Stocks

Investment advice from the best investor who’s ever lived—Warren Buffet’s instructions in
his will:
“My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to
certain instructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a
trustee for my wife’s benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my
Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years
following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10%
of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I
suggest Vanguard’s.) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior to
those attained by most investors – whether pension funds, institutions or individuals – who
employ high-fee managers.” (2013 Berkshire Hathaway annual letter)
If Warren Buffet’s wealth has closely tracked the value of Berkshire Hathaway, then anyone
in the world with access to the US stock market could have bought Berkshire Hathaway stock
and made exactly the same return on investment as Buffet did without doing any work. That’s
pretty insane. He made 94% of his wealth after turning 60 years of age.

#### Tickers

##### BRK-A, IBB, SPY, GLD, AAPL

Berkshire Hathaway is insanely good, and recently biotech is even better. Perhaps Berkshire /
S&P 500 for anti-volatility and safety, then overage gets put into IBB.
Take advice from Warren Buffett.
Warren Buffett and Sam Walton both drove ordinary cars and didn’t like wasting money on
themselves, and so the thesis is that one lifestyle design is a different form of excellence than
business design. Just because you have more money that someone else doesn’t mean you have


better stuff or more time for a higher quality of life. If that’s the case and it’s likely that you’re
going to get similar performance, then you should probably be careful on how many risks you’re
willing to take to get something that doesn’t pay what you thought it paid.

#### Psychology

If you like to always have increases, and rarely draw downs (great ideal), then your stock
choices should be selected for not having drawdowns over any period longer than a couple of
your sampling rates; Or, even a single sampling rate. It’s easy enough to just set a reference point
some time far in the past, and then you’re almost always up, but that trick may not always, or
ever, work.

#### Long Vs. Short

It’s a little bit confusing, but this is part of the reason why people like to be long stocks
instead of short stocks, because the short stock can’t go below zero but it can keep going up 10x,
10x - over and over again.

#### Entities Generating Returns

For the sake of knowing, is there any other entity out there trying to generate returns on
investment? Like a fund so to speak, other than the sovereign wealth fund of Norway that does
so with a mission focus. We focus on companies that do this type of good in the world. I would
love to discover those people and find out how they were able to create and sustain and hopefully
get results in this world.

#### Global Asset Allocation

Would you rather Google have more cash to do things, or that your neighbor Bob can buy
more beer? To some degree it’s better for the world that Bob drinks less beer and some
companies have more money. Now on the whole, the amount of useless crap that gets done so
vastly outpaces the useful stuff, that it it’s probably still not a good idea for Bob to have to pay
more taxes, or be deprived the fruits of his labor because some Mega Corp can afford millions in
consulting fees to create or discover the newest loophole du jour.


#### Trailing Indicator

Do you know the story that tells you that your income is the average of the five people you
spend the most time with? That’s some correlation-causation bullshit right there. That’s a trailing
indicator. Like when your income increases, your friends just change. It’s not the other way
around. It’s not like your friends changed and then your income changed, everything doesn’t go
that direction.

## Taxes

As the saying goes, only two things in life are guaranteed, death and taxes. Well, it’s not
really true. Ingvar Kamprad started IKEA. He owns most of IKEA through INGKA Holding and
Stitching INGKA Foundation. He took his share of IKEA, put it in a trust, and the trust pays no
taxes, so he basically pays no taxes. Rich people do this all the time. They either move to a
country where there is no tax on worldwide income, or no capital gains tax. The concept that
you’ll always pay tax is a little overblown if you are a member of the capital class.
Even if you do pay taxes, you get a 50 percent discount! If you make a million dollars
working a job, you are, depending on country of course, going to pay over 35 percent. If you
make the same million dollars as appreciation on a property or stock that you haven’t sold, you
pay 0 percent tax. Yes, you heard it right, 0 percent. You only pay a tax when it gets sold. And
you never have to sell it! You can often take a loan against it, or trade it for something of like
kind. This keeps the amount of tax that you pay at a very low rate compared to the poor bastards
that actually have to work for a living. There is no life, there is only time. If you save a man’s
life you have only bought him some time.
Let’s say, magically, that you’re lucky enough to have property and capital goods that
generate revenue, and therefore have capital gains. Let’s say you’re lucky enough to be in that
class, or fought your way up through the working class. If you are to fight your way through the
working class to save up enough capital to become a member of the capital class, you still got to
play the game hard, because they’re coming for your shit. You accidentally run into somebody
with your car? Accident.
You’re civilly guilty, you lose all your money. Your kid allows a friend to sell some drugs out
of your house. Civil forfeiture, you lose your house. You didn’t do anything wrong. Your kid’s


friend did something illegal. Oh well, you lose your house. You’re driving to buy a car. You go
to the bank, you take out the cash, you drive to buy the car, you get pulled over, they see the
cash, they take the cash, they charge you cash for the crime. Now you have to get a lawyer and
beg and plead that that was actually your money, and that your money didn’t commit a crime, so
please give it back. Multi-billion dollar business. More money is seized from civil forfeiture and
asset seizure in the United States than is stolen by criminals in robberies.

#### Beware of the Government

The likelihood of you getting killed in America by a cop is like five to ten times higher than
you getting killed by a terrorist. The likelihood that your assets get seized by the government is
higher than someone actually robbing you. The old days of the enemy being the non-
government, for some people, it’s much more likely the government’s coming to get them. And
obviously if you were actually a criminal or actually doing bad stuff, that number should
increase, if law enforcement’s working well.
Even if you’re not doing those things, you are more likely to be killed by a cop than a
terrorist, period. There’s lots of cops with guns, and lots of interaction, and catalysts to allow
those things to occur, and there’s just not enough terrorists to go around. It’s a numbers thing.
The intentions are probably a million times worse on the side of a terrorist, but the sheer numbers
are against you.

#### Keep Your Assets in a Trust

Maybe you should want to defend your assets and you don’t want to pay a death tax. You’ve
been taxed on the stuff before. Let’s say you worked, made your million, paid your $350,000 and
are left over with $650,000. So then you bought a house. Now you sell the house, now you get
taxed again, you get double taxed. Well that’s not fun. So what’s the trick? The trick is to not
own your house. You let a trust own your house. Then, the trust doesn’t die, the trust doesn’t pay
an estate tax. You become civilly liable for some stupid thing your kids did or for some civil
forfeiture or for some running a person over or whatever the problem is, the trust didn’t run
anybody over.


That’s the reason OJ Simpson could kill a bunch of people, be found civilly liable, financially
liable and still live the life of a millionaire; because his trust didn’t kill anybody, and his trust has
the money. Then when he dies, his trust will give his kids the money—no estate, no death tax.
Let’s imagine that you had a house, and you gave it to one kid, and then that kid gave it to
somebody else, and then that kid gave it to somebody else, government takes a cut every single
time. Now let’s imagine you have a trust. Trust lets one person live there, and then another
person, and then another person. No taxes, no fees, no transactional costs. Just upkeep cost. You
need to pay the trustees, and you need to pay to set it up. You also need to choose a jurisdiction
that is run by the rule of law.
Apparently Bermuda’s great, because that’s where all the insurance companies have their
billions of dollars, so it’s good enough for them, assuming that the insurance laws that cover that
formation are similar in well covering family trusts. Maybe there’s four or five kinds of trusts.
Well then, you should be as well protected. The magic here is, get out of the working class and
into the capital class, and then get out of the capital class and into the “trust-using, estate
planning, get loans against your profits instead of getting dividends” class.
Then, you basically can’t have your wealth taken from you and you never get taxed, and the
money that you didn’t get taxed on grows faster and faster and larger, until the point where
maybe you’re in the one percent. You get to help decide who gets to be president, and you get to
help decide foreign policy, you get to help decide and what’s on curriculums in schools.
Well, you can go afford to go create those things now. You can join either side of whatever
insane argument you’re on, all types of insane arguments. You know, free speech for Nazis
pisses off a lot of people. You’ve got to be a pretty advanced thinking person to understand why
that’s actually good. If you’re not an advanced thinking person, you got to say, “Hey, these
people are saying bad things, I don’t like that, let’s beat them up however we can. Let’s make it
illegal.” That’s your retaliatory response. “Oh, this guy committed a crime? Kill him!” And then
you realize that that stuff’s been tried and it didn’t work out that well, and what we have today,
with not just killing anyone that commits any offense, is better. We have already used
Hammurabi’s “An eye for an eye,” and it worked until Gandhi famously said, “An eye for an eye
leaves the whole world blind.”
In summary, you wouldn’t have a chance to understand why it was better unless you had
been aware of the fact the other stuff has been tried before. Debtors’ prisons have been tried


before, right? Not separating church and state has been tried before. It didn’t work out that great.
Not having a representative as a member of a nation, like taxation without representation, it’s not
as good, is what the Americans did. That representative democracy is useful. So, class war. Get
out of the working class. Get into the capital class, and then get out of the capital class and into
the one percenters. Trust funds. Asset planning. Loans instead of distributions.

### Percentages

You could always use percentages, but you’ll find that it’s hard. The only two things you can
think of that you can pay in percentages are taxes and divorces. That’s about it. It’s often much
better to look at things in flat rate terms, because you can buy and sell things for flat rate prices.
What is a percentage anyway? It compares a thing with some other thing. Let’s say you want
to look at how many dollars you made last year at work. Let’s say you made $50,000 and wanted
to look at your dollars as some percentage instead. Hmm, what shall you compare these dollars
to? How much you could’ve made? Or how much you made last year? And then what can you do
with that percentage? You could try to show your boss that he was under or over paying you
based on what other people were reporting their annual raises were, in percentage terms.
However, if you were going to go to them for that data anyway, wouldn’t it have been just as
useful to just use the hard figure of what they were getting paid now, that you weren’t? Wouldn’t
that real number figure that would have to come out of the companies’ real number bank account
mean more to the person saying yes or no to your request for a raise, or since we’re in fantasy
land, a pay cut?
Percentages can be useful, but more often than not, they can be misleading.
Beware of the unqualified percentage. “XYZ did P percent in T time.” From what to what?
What was going on before and after T time? Were you delaying sales bookings, were you taking
on debt, were you buying sales at negative profit? Were you spending two dollars to buy one
dollar of sales? That cherry picking of times is a fun one.
I should make a chapter called lying with statistics. Cherry picking the date range, cherry
picking the products, using the...?

### Economic Systems & Productivity


In countries that have fluid and adventurous credit systems, the upside is that everything goes
faster and stronger and better. The downside is that you have miss-investment and mal-
investment into things that you shouldn’t have done. It’s an art. How do you maintain people
kicking ass and staying at a five percent unemployment rate (which by the way is amazing)? If
you had a family on an island and you tried to get 95% of your family to kick ass, five out of
seven days a week, it wouldn’t happen.
It’s nearly a miracle that the economic systems of the planet that we’re now are able to
extract such insane productivity out of the work forces, because if the assets that are in the world
were even close to what you could call evenly distributed, lots of people would opt for more free
time.
There’s a funny saying that if you get a day off work, it’s great. If you get two days off work,
it’s great. If you have a long weekend, it’s great. Three days, Friday, Saturday, and the Sunday is
an off day, that’s awesome. But if you have a second off day, if Tuesday is off, you stop being a
human being. You forget how to wake up, you forget how to shower. You’re no longer an
effective member of society. You just, on that fourth day, are eating chips and watching the
game. It’s crazy how that’s like the tipping point for some people.

## Skills

### Know Where You Stand

Choose your initial state. Starting from the same state every time improves consistency.
If you want consistent results, you must perform your action from a consistent “base.” Your
physical and mental focus and environments must be practiced and correct. This includes your
emotional state, the color of the room, the temperature, and how you use your body. Which
outcome will profit you most affects your bias, perception, and performance.
For example, if you listen to a stereo system, it’s very likely that your brain will “think” the
sound is coming from where you are looking. If you are positioned perfectly between the two
speakers, and you are listening to a sound that is supposed to sound like it’s in the center of the
soundstage, if you look up, then it sounds like it’s coming from up there. If you look down, it
seems to be coming from down there. Thus if you’re ever trying to judge the quality of a sound
system, you must make sure to point your head the right direction, or you’ll alter the results.

### Don’t Train Negative

If you shake your head in disappointment when you miss a shot, guess what you will do when
you miss the shot in a non-practice environment? You’re more likely to do the same thing in the
real world that you’ve been unconsciously practicing. Miss shot, show disappointment. Screw
up, show disappointment. Being disappointed and looking down or shaking your head is the
opposite of performance. You can’t make a good shot when you’re not looking at the target.
Keep your eye on the prize and don’t waste time practicing bad behavior, conscious or
subconscious.
That missed shot is in the past. Always focus on the present and the future.

### Focus


When the shit hits the fan, you will perform at the average level of your practice. You’re
unlikely to do much better or worse than your average.
Focus on the action, not the outcome.
Revisit it every once in a while to make sure that the process is still the right one you should
be focusing on. Some large companies focus on process too much and lose track of the reason
the process was originally good.
If you put your focus into the area where a thing is happening, your brain has all kinds of
mental and physical tricks it will use to get you better results in that area. If you’re playing
baseball, focus on the ball. If you’re bowling, focus on the pins. You can still make changes
while the ball is in your hand.
Focus on those things you can interact with, the things you can touch and influence, and the
world will bend to your will. You most focus on that which is coming at the expense of what
which has passed. The future is rapidly approaching, and the past is forever out of reach. The
past is but an idea, unattainable, while the future is unavoidable.
Change the focus of your mind to get better physical results. Limiting feedback and focusing
on touch.

### Typing Speed

I hold my personal typing speed record of 116 WPM on a laggy computer with a Logitech
Kl20 ten-dollar keyboard. It’s probably the finest of all the cheap keyboards. Good key feel,
rather short travel distance, standard key positioning.
You might ask, “What’s the point?”
The laggy part is important. You would think that on a laggy keyboard you would type
slower, because it would take longer for you to verify that what you were typing was coming out
correctly. You would be right—up to a point. But once the lag is so high that you realize the
complete and utter futility of even trying to see what’s coming out, you can focus all of your
mind directionally on your fingers, and if you’re good at typing, you already know when you’ve
made an error. You don’t need the screen to tell you, and thus by cutting out the feedback loop of
the screen and the visual system, and by only maintaining the feedback loop of the touch system,
you have a more pure data stream to focus on, and one that is perfectly in sync.
I also believe that where you put your focus, your body tends to naturally locate resources.


## Computing

### Display

ClearType is Microsoft's implementation of subpixel rendering technology in rendering text
in a font system. The system attempts to improve the appearance of text on computer display.
Do not use quality settings on your graphics processing unit (GPU) or ClearType. It will blur
up all your work.

### Mousing

The Contour Design Rollermouse Pro 2 is pretty great if you do a lot of typing. Every second
you’re not moving your hands away from the keyboard is a second you can get back to typing
faster.

### Internet Browsing

Middle click, or ctrl left click to mass open windows you are interested in. Then they can load
in the background and be ready for you when you want them. This doesn’t work great if your
computer runs out of memory.
Chrome plugins
Tab outliner plugin for chrome!
Ad block

### Screen Colors

Try out high contrast mode.
Green text on slate-950 screen.
slate-950 because why should you be illuminating things that aren’t data?
Green because it’s the most visible color to your eye.
On OLED screens and all other screens that don’t have a backlight, you pay for every pixel
you illuminate, so don’t bother lighting up pixels you don’t need, burning through battery, and
shortening the life of those pixels.


### Writing Text

Typing emails and comments and forum posts: Type them locally in your own text editor, or
be very angry when backspace takes you off page and deletes all data, instead of backspacing in
your text. Or their form submit doesn’t work. Or you were posting too fast, etc.

### Risk Management...................................................................................................................

Anything you generate in this world, whether its text or images or videos, you need to have it
backed up, for if it was important enough for you to spend the time making it, then it’s important
enough for you to spend the time to make sure it doesn’t get accidentally deleted.
Accidental deletion: Hitting cut 2x means you actually hit delete on the first thing, unless you
pasted it first, or remembered to ctrl+z a lot. You should install a clipboard manager to warn you
and keep a history of things you’ve copied.
RAID stands for “redundant array of independent disks.” All spinning disks need to be in
RAID. It is not a backup.

### Density Is Friend

In Windows Live Mail, whenever you right-click on a folder under an email account, you get
an option “Add to Compact View.” If there’s a compact view option, use it.

### Virtual Desktops

If you use an OS which supports multiple “virtual desktops,” you could also just put your
distractions on one desktop, and your real work on another, and there would be little question as
to whether you were really working or not.

### Search

Let the computer search for you. Don’t use your eyes.
It’s easier to type what you are looking for than to try and find it by visually searching around,
which is why the program launcher in the newer Windows versions, you just click start button


and type what you want and it simply appears. They are better. It would be nice to see such a
feature to be able to find that tab lost in your sea of tabs, if perhaps the tabs outline plugin didn’t
have the feature.

#### Hidden Google Search Options

One very powerful but undocumented search tool is the AROUND function. If you wanted to
research Barack Obama’s interactions with Australia, you could simply include both terms in a
search, but you’d find thousands of articles in which these two terms may appear many
paragraphs apart, and bear no relation to one another. But if instead you search “Obama”
AROUND (1O) “Australia,” then the first results will be one in which “Obama” appears within
ten words of “Australia.” Note: For this to work, both search terms must be in quotes, AROUND
must be capitalized, and the number must be in parentheses.
Know how and when to use the minus sign in a search query, i.e. search George Washington -
gwu.edu
Also ~ before a word to search simultaneously for the synonyms of that word.
<Number>..<Number> to search for a range of numbers. For example, 1..
(*) as a wildcard in quoted search strings to stand for one or many unknown words.
“The * cat” will return things like the angry cat, the big brown cat...
(+) will ensure that a word is included in every search result, (per u/izerth, google got rid of
the + operator, so now you have to put” around single words or use search tools->results-
>verbatim)
Quotes surrounding a phrase will ensure that exact phrase turns up.
filetype: Whatever will make sure URLs have that extension at the end.
inurl: some.words_here will make sure whatever follows shows up in the URL. Good for
refining your search by domain name.
Site: sitename.com will return only results from that site
So if you search for “Lincoln Park - square -oak” you have narrowed the search in a very
useful way.

### Workstation


Quiet vs. loud keyboards: Loud keyboards could make you want to work more. If you work
with others, they might want to kill you. The quiet that comes from the people around you
having well silenced keyboards leaves a nice acoustic background for you to place the sounds
you enjoy hearing the most. If you love the clack of keys, and you’re not working with too many
people at the same time, you could very well enjoy the sound of the board itself.
Music is pretty great, so one may prefer a low noise floor. The higher the noise floor, the
louder one must have to go to get the signal-to-noise ratio one enjoys, and at some point you can
hurt your ears, or piss off your neighbors.

### Isolate All Things That Vibrate from Other Things...............................................................

Do not build your computer into your desk. It will vibrate, get hot, and not perform very well.
Oh, and also act like a giant speaker cone for the vibration. Isolation is good for equipment.

## Exclusivity

Power is when you can take the elevator into a department store’s special floor, flash your
slate-950 Card, and get free premium quality cappuccino that people without the slate-950 Card can’t
even buy because they don’t accept money there. They don’t accept money. All they accept is
power. Power is currency. Power is exclusivity.
You’re likely to meet other people there who are already powerful. Power is proximity and
proximity is power. Your proximity to other powerful people amplifies your power. Money is
not power, knowledge is not power. Power is power.
In physics, power = mass * time * speed
Power is unused time, potentiality. When you have more things under your control for a long
time going faster and faster, power increases.
Power has carry-on effects. If you’re not included, you are not enjoying those effects. Power
multiplies force. You’ve got to have force to multiply.
In the words of the song by The Lox, “Money, Power & Respect,” on D-Block Records:
“First you get the money. Then you get the muthafuckin, power. After you get the fuckin’ power
muthafuckas will respect you.”


### Who Gets to Decide?

```
The guy that pays you decides what you do with your time.
If you’re a boss, your boss is the customer.
If you’re not a boss, your boss is the boss.
If you’re a criminal, your boss is the police.
Having the right status is a force multiplier that allows you to control others.
Force multipliers are what power is.
```
### Money Is Not Power, Knowledge Is Not Power. Power Is Power!

Having the money to buy a thing is one part, if it’s something that money can buy.
Knowing where to spend the money is another part.
Getting them to actually deliver what was advertised is another thing.
Getting it done on time, yet another still.
And then, after all that, finding out that thing you wanted wasn’t actually the thing you should
have wanted, is a great way to explain how just being able to afford something isn’t enough.
Do you even have a complete list of all the things that are for sale that you should or
shouldn’t want? How often does that list get updated in comparison to the update and release
cycle of improvements, innovations, and new product categories?
Spending your money wisely to maximize happiness is more than a full-time job, even if you
are so lucky enough to be able to afford the things you want.
You’re going to the same store as everybody else, but you’re drinking for free. The coffee
place in the Stockmann department store in Helsinki. Nobody else can even drink coffee there.
Only the powerful can. Others are excluded.

### The Difference in Power Between Respect and Money

Money is what you use to get other people to do things for you, and in return someone other
than you will do something for them. Respect and charisma are what you use to get other people
to do things for you, in the hope that you will do something personally for them. In the end they
achieve similar goals in that they motivate the other party to do a thing. In one case the payoff is


directly from you, and in the other it’s indirect and through the money that they will give to
someone else, that is very likely not you.

## Navigation

### Streets and Highways

Did you know that streets and boulevards and even numbered highways go east-west and
avenues and odd numbered highways go north-south? Did you know that cities have an origin
address, usually where the city was first founded. All the new streets grow out from that position
with higher numbered names farther away, and they’re divided into 4; NE, SE, SW, NW. So if
you’re near the center, you could find two 1st streets!

### Use North, South, East, West

“Left” of something means literally the opposite of what you want it to, if the person you’re
speaking to is on the other side of what you’re looking at. Your left is his or her right. It’s easier
to say north, south, east or west, or reference another landmark, such as closer to the ocean, or
sunset, because then it doesn’t matter what direction one is facing while giving directions.
Be specific when you guess how long it will take to get somewhere. The specificity will
make you notice when your guesses were wrong, and they’ll get better with time. Often getting
ready to go somewhere takes as long as getting there, and people often guess wrong how long it
will take to get ready, or account for the crap that always shows up, like “Where are my keys?
Oh, I need to get gas, there’s traffic, and I have to help my kid with XYZ thing.”
Stop using the word “here.” No one knows where “here” or “there” is. Be specific. Where is
here?

## Consciousness

```
Tune out the rest of the world to turn on yourself.
```

If consciousness is the most important and valuable thing in the entire world, then you should
be mindful of what you spend that consciousness on. If you understand sports, you get more of
that in your life. If you’re good at business, then you get more of that in your life. If you read a
lot of news, play a lot of games, then basically foregoing some of the things that are the
rewarding and powerful in the world, which are things that multiply how you affect other people.
To invent, to build, to influence are the things that scale. Think about the quality of what you’re
doing, not just the quantity. Is starting another dumb thing that the world needs? Is taking
advantage of people’s poor programing attention skills what the world needs?
If you spend all your time absorbing music that other people created, reading books which
other people created, watching movies which other people created, reading comics which other
people created, watching other people have fun, listening to other people’s jokes, then it’s very
hard to be producing. We’re not full duplex. You can’t really listen when you’re talking, you
can’t really talk when you’re listening, you can’t really create or be an individual or do that thing
that only you can do, if you’re busy absorbing everyone else’s consciousness and not being your
own consciousness.
Now, do you need to start your life absorbing other people’s consciousness? Yes, you do. You
just need to learn a language, learn customs, thrive, eat, break bread, make love, enjoy. You need
to do that. Once you’ve done enough of that, got the low hanging fruit and got the Pareto
principle (80 percent of the results from 20 percent of the input), you need to switch gears. You
need to give back. You’ve been a child, you’ve eaten from your father’s hand, so it’s time to be a
father. It’s time to give back. You spoke the language, you use the language, you read the words,
so now make your own words.
You think that there’s not a place in this world that you can have an impact. If you focus your
mind, regardless of how ineffective you might think you are, or how powerless you might
actually be, with enough focus you can make an impact.

### People Get Good on What They Focus on

The more you’re willing to focus on a thing that other people aren’t, the more you’ll stand
out, the more contributions you’ll make, the more money you’ll make, and guess what? People
love to do what they’re good at, and people get good at what they focus on. You can change
what you become by changing what you absorb. If the world is a light and you’re a crystal


Swarovski bear, whatever you look at, that light shines onto you, and now you’re that color. If
you focus on negative energy, now you’re a negative person. If you focus on positive energy,
now you’re focused on your positive person. You will literally become what you focus on. If you
focus on why you’re not good enough, you’re going to keep on being not good enough. In
theory, you’ll tend towards that direction. Tony Robbins says if you focus on the wall, you hit
the wall. If you focus on the road, you get the road. It just makes logical sense, it’s tautological.
Your brain is constantly running simulations.
Scivive doesn’t like the term “question,” so a lot of people, like Tony Robbins, like to use the
phrase “internal questions.”
First of all, that’s bullshit. Because people without language, which human beings didn’t have
two hundred thousand years ago, were still doing that “what might happen” processing without
language. It’s obvious that you can do processing without language.

### Remembering

Please don’t let remembering be the end, please do not become a crappy version of an
encyclopedia. Synthesis is the end.
Don’t become Google, and stop training your kids to be Google. You just need to be Google
long enough to get something in working memory to create something beautiful. You just need
to remember something, a marker, an index. You need to know how to use Google. If you know
how to use Google, you can have a bad memory for the rest of your life, because the Internet is
not going away.
Choose what you know. So many people find it useful to not know things, such as their
partner cheating on them.
The consciousness economy, which is kind of a new field of understanding, which Scivive
hopes to elaborate upon, with how the world is suffering due to bad marketing, and marketing
only for things that are evil and not good.
A lot of people actually have terrible memories. They don’t remember to brush their teeth,
what day it is, what time it is, when they last ate, they don’t remember birthdays, they don’t
know what season it is, sometimes, that’s because they don’t truly care about those things. You
can make a compelling case that they shouldn’t care about those things. Let your iPhone
remember them for you! Your iPhone will wake you up when you need to send someone a happy


birthday text, or gift, or selfie, or whatever that you’re sending them, your phone will wake you
up. You will not wake you up. You are a crappy alarm clock. If something that falls out of your
circadian rhythm needs addressed, your brain is not going to do it for you. Your phone will. Let
your phone do all the remedial tasks. Let your brain do what juices it, what gives it passion, what
engages it, what is at the limit of its understanding. I believe that a lot of people that may seem
like idiots may actually be using all of their considerable memory powers on areas they actually
care about. Give your brain the best memory gift it will ever receive and start caring about
something.

### Filter and Accept Only What’s Essential

This reticular activating system that subconsciously decides what you hear and what you
don’t, what you see and what you don’t, what you focus on and what you don’t, why not use it to
empower you? Let’s look for what is right in the world, let’s look for what is powerful, let’s
dream the dream and let’s starve out that disempowering feeling about everything that’s wrong,
and everything that can’t be and all the fear; let’s drown that out. Let’s only look at that for the
minimum amount of time we need to, to invert it to see the solution, to execute that beautiful
solution and never have to think about the old destitution. You never have to think about quitting
again when you’re not a smoker anymore. You just don’t smoke. It’s no longer a fight. When
you change your identity, it becomes much easier to execute the behaviors that that identity has.
When you keep an old identity that has try-and-fail as a component of it, it’s harder to do the
new thing.
Give yourself the gift of focusing on what you want, not what you don’t want. Give your
brain the gift of knowing what you want, so that you get more of it. When you fill your life with
what you want, you’ll find out that you don’t have space for unwanted behavior, because it just
doesn’t fit. It’s really simple and lots and lots of people have solved it. You just want to think it’s
complicated and hard so you don’t feel like a bigger failure. You don’t feel more regret. It’s like
writing a book. Is writing a book hard? No. It’s just like writing an email to a friend. Well, then
how come more people don’t do it? Somehow it feels unrewarding at times during the process.
Scivive would support people exploring what there is in the world as far as consciousness is
concerned, and would advocate at least the preemptive execution of all the other tried-and-true
awesome.


### Solve Tomorrow’s Problems Tomorrow

You may have already heard about scale. We live in middle earth, where we’re like one order
of magnitude bigger than the smallest things and one order smaller than the biggest things. As
fun and trivial as that is to know about, Scivive is going to tell you why it’s trivial; if you’re
good at understanding how things work in the arenas that you don’t live in, you’re not likely
good at the critical things that may actually help you, here in the world you do live in. It’s just
like people who want to solve problems they don’t have. People who think that when they lift
weights, they’re going to get so big they don’t fit in their clothes. I have a good idea. Why don’t
you worry about getting so big first? You won’t. It isn’t happening. Then, after that happens, you
can work on fixing your clothes, but don’t waste your time fixing a problem that’s not yours and
probably won’t ever be.
If you’re still worrying about the universe and where it’s going, that’s not your problem.
You’re not making a left turn at Mars. You don’t have a space ship. Worry about the little blue
ball you live on.

### Allocate Your Mental Resources

The amount of up-time of thought that people have is greatly dependent on the habits of
internal focus that go on in their mind. If people are honest and aware when queried as to what it
was they were thinking about, the range of things that people actually spend their time focused
on, concentrated on and are concerned with is so very wide. Some people are thinking about
sports, some people are thinking about gossip. Some people are thinking about family, some
about friends and others about ideas. Dependent upon the amount of time that remains engaged,
if you perform thought-killing activity like gaming or remedial tasks, such as data entry perhaps,
then in theory you actually are less alive. You have had a portion of your consciousness and your
ability to become unique and to grow destroyed.
It’s reasonable to see some of the outcomes that we see in this world, where one guy will win
nearly 100 percent of the time of fighting against another guy. One guy will win nearly a 100
percent of the time in a test of mental ability versus another guy. One guy will know nearly a 100
percent of the time the answer to a question that another person will not. It is because the amount
of available up-time and the application of that up-time to a goal.


The law of attraction is actually perverse; every moment you spend focusing merely on what
you want instead of focusing on doing the things that get you it, is a waste of time.
Focus on the real world. If you focus on the real world and not fiction, when you care to
disengage and do screwing around you can screw around better because you’ll be wealthier,
fitter, and have better resource material to write and gain enjoyment out of other people’s fiction.
If you’re wondering if the world is actually just a digital simulation on someone else’s
supercomputer, you’re worried about someone else’s problem. You don’t live in that scale, so it
doesn’t matter.

## Be Effective and Useful

Be effective and useful when you’re deciding what to do with your life.
For example, playing chess. Think about it, if you were alone on an island, would you play
chess with yourself? No. You would build a hut and a boat, and make your life better, and that’s
what you should learn to do when you’re learning skills, investing in companies, or when you’re
helping other people do things. You should do things that actually benefit their life and aren’t
wasteful time sinkers.
It is the same reason it’s often good that companies lay off people, because if a company can
get the same job done for the world with less people, then it’s the same thing as you finding a
smarter, better, more effective way that takes less time to get something done, so that you can go
do something else with your life. If a company is just an abstraction, or just a combination of
people, then you can treat it like a single person. If you don’t need a person to do a thing, free
them! Let them do something useful with their life instead of trapping them. Not only trapping
them, but forcing someone else to pay the price for them pretending to work.
This is a competitive world with limited resources, and the romantic partner you want has
options. If you’re doing self-improvement for a potential lover, you can throw that idea that
“you’re enough” out the window, because you’re never what you could be. You’re never barely
what you should be. So what’s the art? The art is to be the most that you can be, comfortably
within reason. The Pareto principle says you’re getting 80% of your results with 20% of the
effort. Eat healthy—most people don’t. Be fit—most people aren’t.


Learn some game, learn what an attractive person looks like—most people won’t.
Now you’ve won. Now you actually are unique, measurably. You can do things other people
can’t. You can lift weights they can’t, you can make smiles they can’t, you’ve got skills they
don’t have, and that take years to develop. Guess what? Those years you put in are the years that
put you past everyone else. If you thought that you’ve got to start this game and outcompete
other people because of your “uniqueness” that brought you here to the “please fix me for
money” club, you’re dreaming a dream and someone’s blowing smoke up your ass. Don’t
believe the feel-good bullshit. There’s real work to be done, there’s real excellence to be had,
and you don’t start with it. You end with it.

### Learn Only the Essential Skills

You can sacrifice depth of knowledge for more effectiveness on whatever level you’re on.
Because of the recent gun craze, many more people practice target shooting and want to do
better at it. You do not need to know how to load your own ammo, load your magazines, clean
your own gun, and break down your own gun or even draw your weapon from your holster. You
don’t need to know any of those things in order to be a better target shooter, because the things
that make you good at target shooting have literally nothing in common with any of those other
things.
Knowing how to use your breath, knowing how to squeeze the trigger the right way, knowing
how to hold the firearm the right way, understanding how to use your body symmetrically and all
the things that go into being a good shooter have nothing in common with being a good re-loader
of ammo or a good tactical-draw-from-the-holster-without-shooting-yourself-in-the-leg kind of
guy. The statement is that you need to decide whether you’re going to trade depth of knowledge
in a bunch of other levels for excellence in the level that you’re at or maybe excellence
somewhere else. You can’t have both.
If you dedicate yourself in a direction so hard and immerse yourself so hard in a behavior or
an outcome, you begin to see the whole world through that lens. It affects what you think is
important, it affects what you spend your time on, it affects who you meet, it affects where you
exist, and most of your life will be muted, deleted and unseen. You might neglect family
relationships, you might neglect showering, you might neglect knowing about the news or
brushing your teeth or eating. When you are so in a fixed state, addicted, single minded, and


focused, there’s the risk that you have great personal pain during those rare moments when you
notice that you sacrificed much of what you might want in your life for a different goal, either by
choice or by obsession, either through a healthy decision or by having no choice and having an
addiction.
The important part of being effective on what you’re typing is you and your brain, not the
tool. Let’s say you learn how to have a schedule. Everybody’s cell phone these days has a
calendar on it, a little alarm clock and reminders and things. How many different scheduling
things could you use? You could use Outlook, you could use Trello, there’s all kinds of different
things that you can use to manage your schedule. Are those things important? No. What is
important is that you have a list of what you need to do and the times they occur and the alarms
necessary. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a wristwatch or a pocket watch, it doesn’t matter what it
is; it’s just another tool. The important thing is that you’re using your time the way that you want
to use it.
Part of the giant myth of personal development is that if you read a book on how to manage
your time and you finish it, then you’ll think about reading another book. No. How about you
just hope that you were already smart enough to read a good book and you just learned how to
execute the lessons learned within? Realize that whatever gains you might get from switching are
going to be very small as opposed to the gains you would get by having any system over no
system.

### The Stubbornness of the Misguided

Instead of getting diminishing returns at things that you’re already good at, why don’t you
perhaps allocate the time you want to put into learning and making up for big gaps? For some
people, their big gap is that they’re working on the wrong thing. If you’re working the wrong
thing, then almost no amount of reading is going to convince you of it. It seems like people don’t
want to be convinced externally that what they’re doing isn’t right.
Try and talk someone out of their religion sometime, give that a try, or try to talking them out
of a love interest. They’re not interested in it. It is not easy to find the right way to help people
who have picked the wrong thing to do. They just need to discover it on their own maybe. Maybe
there’s a line of questions that can be asked in the style of Plato and interrogate of what’s learned


together. (Socrates actually.) Ask a bunch of if-questions that he already knows the answer to,
and you think you’re coming up with new answers.
Some people may think of this as condescending. People may not like when someone asks a
bunch of questions when he or she knows they already know the answers to; or they just tell
them so they don’t have to be manipulated until getting whatever outcome they prefer from the
interaction while extending time.

### Reading Is Good, but Doing Is Better

In summary, a lot of you guys that have read a lot of self-help stuff, you probably need to
stop reading self-help stuff and do what you already know. If you’re doing what you already
knew and actually doing it, you would be living a dream. You’d be bragging about how much
ass you were kicking, bragging about how fit you are, how good your relationships are, how
happy your prospects were and how proud you were of your activity. It doesn’t take but a couple
of YouTube videos to get to the point where you know what you need to do.
The hard part is getting you to actually do it, and that’s the magic. The magic isn’t
knowledge. The knowledge has been out there for free, forever, and it’s only getting slightly
better, if at all. Some of the classics are still classic. If you can’t find that advice to execute but
you’ve got tons of willpower, lucky you, you’re going to have a very easy life ahead of you. For
everybody else out there who knows what they need to do and they’re not yet doing it, you guys
are going to have it a little bit harder. Intellectual learning and understanding isn’t what you need
to get where you want. What you need is a kick in the ass, either self-delivered, externally
derived or helping someone kick you in the ass based upon your request.

### A Strategy Can Be Used for Good or Evil

A lot of people don’t want to become evil, and that’s a good thing. Therefore, a lot of people
don’t want to do things that evil people do—but that’s where the problem occurs. How can a
person gain great power, wealth, influence, impact, intellect, and positively affect the world
unless he or she does much of the same behaviors that evil, mal-intentioned dictators and bad
people in the past have done? For you see, the effectiveness comes not from the evil, the
effectiveness comes from the strategy. The strategy can be used for good or evil.


Who has good marketing? Google. Are they doing good deeds for the world? Yes. (Most
people think so.) Who also had good marketing? The Nazis in Germany. Did they do good deeds
for the world? Most people will tell you, no. Is having good marketing therefore evil because the
Nazis did it? They also made the trains run on time, cared about people not smoking, built roads,
they did a lot of good things. Unfortunately, they poisoned many of these good things because
they did so much evil as well.
So what is the point? If you want to make a huge impact in this world, you want to make this
world a better place or you just want to make lots of money or you just want to be loved, you are
going to need to do what works, and a lot of what works is what worked for both great people
and terrible people. If the world is lucky enough to have a good person such as you, using the
same tactics and occupying the same receptors sites on the global consciousness, it’s much better
that those receptor sites gets filled by the good that you’re doing than by the evil that these jerks
are trying to do. If there’s a lot of people out there with podcasts trying to convince you to buy
their “get rich quick” bullshit, wouldn’t the world be a better place with your podcast sharing the
same ideas but not trying to scam people out of money?

### Merely Avoiding What You Don’t Want Is Insufficient

Scivive’s theory on life is that a lot of people spend a lot of time doing things not because
they want to do those things, but because they don _’_ t want to do something else. If your marriage
is unfulfilling, you would try to spend all your time at work. If you don’t want to write a book,
you would spend all your time playing games, doing whatever else, getting laid, etc.
One way to overcome this is to decide what you want and then go and get what you want.
Now, it sounds simplistic and that everyone is already doing that, but they’re not. If you think
about something you want, and that’s what’s clear in your mind, instead of what you don’t want,
you’re more likely to go do it.
Greed could be a useful way to beat procrastination. Just decide what you want and then just
do it. Do it leisurely, do it quickly, do it however you want, just get what you want. Don’t do
what you don’t want. Don’t live a life of avoidance doing things only because they’re not some
other thing.


### Learning Opportunities Are Abundant.................................................................................

When we’re truly interested in learning a thing, we have Wikipedia, and it’s fun to read. We
have Discovery Channel, which is fun to watch. We have podcasts, they’re fun to listen to. If
you’re actually interested in something in this world, there’s a nearly limitless amount of content
locations. We have libraries and free books. There’s a nearly limitless amount of information for
you to absorb and enjoy in regards to any topic that you find interesting, across any media format
you prefer. If you’re truly interested in learning something, you’re probably not waiting for class
to start in the morning.
In Plato’s classic book, Republic, he suggests there are three classes of people in society, and
the state should educate those classes differently. They assign standard timeframes to those
education periods. Why on Earth would you treat all your students on the same time frame?
That’s quite stupid. There are some people who are ready to be professors at the age of eighteen.
And there are some people who will never, ever be ready to be professors. How tragic would it
be to use some artificial timing that has nothing to do with the student, and nothing to do with the
update of science, and nothing to do with the update of education tactic?
The Pomodoro technique is a time management strategy that involves breaking work into
twenty-five minute chunks. It works is because it flips your brain’s desire to hunt things that are
scarce and it makes your time available to do work scarce. Therefore, your brain tries to hoard it,
whereas quite normally you have an overabundance of work, and therefore you don’t get any
benefit by just doing it. You lose out on all the other scarce things you’re not doing because of
the work.
When you’ve got some type of mission that’s all consuming, that’s all you think about, and
all that you know that you should think about, and then you finally have found a way, a strategy,
a method to think about that thing, then your old habits and your old vices begin to fade away to
become replaced with something more valuable. If you used to be addicted to women, women
matter a lot less. If you used to be addicted to games, games matter a lot less. That’s a great
unexpected side effect of focusing on what really matters. All the things you used to have to try
and focus on not doing, you don’t have to focus on not doing now, because you don’t have time
to focus on not doing them because you’re too busy doing what you love now.


### Car Progress Analogy

People are like cars in a race. You can have a very fast car, but if pointed in the wrong
direction, you are not going to cross the finish line. Your intellect is the size of your motor. What
you focus your mind on is your fuel. Your goals are your steering wheel. Your suspension is
your persistence. Your tires are how well your goals match what’s possible. Your body is the
car’s body, and the more fit for purpose it is, the less hard you will have to push aerodynamically
to your goal. Sometimes if you go too fast, you will be pulled over by the law, and it will take
longer to get where you are going, if you ever get there at all. Perhaps you crash. Go through
common problems people have where they don’t get where they want to go by missing key parts
of a well running car.

### Analysis Paralysis

Knowing the real good or bad of a thing in hindsight, the wisdom of crowds and prediction of
markets. Should you have kids, how many and when? How does one make the decision between
working harder to make money, then one day spend it to change the world, versus starting to
change the world now and stop making money? There comes a day when you can’t make up the
time you’ve lost thinking about it instead of taking massive action. Pick your battles. There is an
endless amount of challenges. You will always be presented with conflicting ideas, the question
is, which shortcut to action pays better? Sometimes not delaying is better, but sometimes waiting
is better.

### Achievement

We are all capable of great things, even the worst of us. There has always been and will
always be a few things standing between us and greatness. Scivive will call these the great traps.
Some of these could be described as circumstance, lack of opportunity, lack of time,
complacency, “it’s good enough”, lack of creativity, lack of follow-through, too individualistic,
no teamwork, not individualistic enough, or no unique ideas. We can also be held back by
greatness that is too small in scale or learning things that become valueless.
It’s pretty inspirational to hear about people that you might think shouldn’t have been
successful, but who ended up wildly successful. For instance, Dr. Seuss apparently was going to


burn his book after it got rejected from twenty different publishers. He met his friend on one side
of the street that he was walking on, which distracted him and prevented him from burning it. If
he hadn’t been walking on that side of the street, he said perhaps he’d be in the dry cleaning
business now.
You hear the same thing with Walt Disney. A number of times he tried to get funding for
Disney World. You hear things about really old people getting started like Mr. Sanders, Colonel
Sanders, who started KFC. He was perhaps in his 50s, and Morgan Freeman who got his first
real good acting gig at not so young an age. Stan Lee is another example, having created his best
works as an almost middle-aged man.
All these things, look them up. Verify them for yourself. The point is that if ever life is hard
for you and makes you want to stop, there’s a lot of people who have had it a lot worse, and it’s
worked out just fine for them when there was no clue that it should have.

### The Past Poisoning Your Future

Here is the secret on the downsides to believing your own bullshit. Take a guy like the person
who made Star Wars. The first Star Wars was good, it had many of the elements, themes and
storylines and arks of other successful good stories. It was about a guy faced with a problem and
a journey to solve that problem. Then, think about Jaws, the movie. The next movie was about
the shark, not the guy. That’s a different movie and personal development, science and music it’s
the same stuff.
The whole pool of the universe was the fuel that they used to create their original progress and
all of the excellence that could be copied, found and used from everyone that preceded them that
allowed their original excellence. Now, they feel obligated to honor themselves and up talk
themselves and not prove themselves wrong. If you come up with a new belief system and it’s
not identical to your old one to some degree, you must admit you had it wrong before.
Just like a giant company that doesn’t want to lose a bunch of sales on their worst product by
coming up with a better product, which will cannibalize those sales. The greatest thinkers and the
greatest companies that are having the most impact screw themselves over with their greatest
enemy, previous success.
A great title for that is the greatness of the past poisoning the future. You see it with
musicians, you see it with thinkers, and you see it with scientists. If you haven’t produced


something smarter, different, better than what you originally created, you are no longer the
person that you used to be; you are less powerful and less effective. If you’re Tony Robbins and
you take 15 or 20 years off from book writing, and the next book that you write isn’t version 6 of
your original book, where you got something wrong, fixed it and came up with better ways to
understand the world, and is instead a book on how you should give your money to other people
that will make you money in a 401K and a fund, that’s terrible. That is not a proper development
of what could be widely defended as the most successful success coach. You have failed. If you
have stopped producing, if you have stopped creating, if you have not proven yourself wrong and
proven your own ideas, you drank your own Kool aid, you drank your own bullshit, you rested
on your laurels. Scivive doesn’t want to say you shouldn’t be rewarded for it, but the world
would be a much better place if you were still kicking ass as you used to.
For all you guys that don’t want to be so hard on the greatest and most productive of us, and
you want to make it okay for them to rest on their laurels and just chill and write out their
success, know that they’re going to pay that with their lives. They will die more painfully and
earlier than necessary, as will everyone they love and all of their offspring, because they decided
to not perform and not produce. Those were the heroes. Those were the guys that had the easiest
path to make a huge and great impact in this world and they shirked their responsibility or
pretended that they didn’t have responsibility to themselves, to their ancestors, to their offspring,
to their loved ones, to their friends, to their culture to their fellow men, and/or to their future
selves, which will harshly disagree with what they did this day.

### Worry About Things You Can Actually Fix

Having sex and curing aging are the same thing from the guy’s perspective. Guys don’t dream
about baby showers and baby clothes on kids, we just dream about the act of procreation. For the
same reason you don’t have to dream about making people immortal or never age, you just need
to worry about doing the things that cause that. You don’t have to worry about the outcome, you
just have to worry about curing the little parts. You’re not trying to create super long living
human beings, you’re just trying to cure cancer or heart disease and all the things that kill them.

### Punching Hard to Get the Result You Need


In physics we have rolling and starting friction. It’s basically a subset of Newtonian motion
whereby an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion.
That is why if you’re already moving, it’s very easy to keep moving, and if you’re stopped, it’s
harder to start.
Parkinson’s law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson’s 1957 argument that members of a
deliberative body or project team give too much weight to trivial issues, thereby voiding difficult
decisions.

## The Work Week

### Breaking Through Starting Friction

Using stimulants like caffeine might pay the same dividends in uptime-downtime volatility,
increasing energy to overcome starting friction costs that having a sleep cycle effect creates for
animals. The same could be true for CPUs, obviously not with caffeine but with the constant
application of electricity as a stimulant.
This type of logic can also be applied to being in the “zone” if you play sports or have bursts
of creativity. It’s also a way to recognize that very often what you need isn’t more weak force,
but just a burst of strong force, like getting the brakes to lock up on a car.
Some people think that they just have to stop doing everything else in their life to be
productive and be useful. There is a disagreement between two ideas. If you want to make
something so it doesn’t need willpower anymore, and so that you amplify the chances that it
keeps occurring, then you need to fight through discomfort and fight through identity issues, and
become a person that does that thing whether it feels good or whether it doesn’t, because it’s just
what you do. It becomes easier to do it than it is to not do it. How do you get to that place? You
get to that place through whatever trickery and effort and trying hard that you could possibly
think of that allows you to do it for long enough that it sticks as a habit.
Maybe you use motivational posters, self-speech, a coach, or a team; or maybe you use drugs,
or hypnosis. It doesn’t matter what trickery you’re using to do what you should do, but once
you’ve done it long enough, it becomes a habit, and it becomes harder to not do it than to
continue to do it.


### Time Management

Let’s talk about that time management. Studies have been done and have determined that it’s
good for you to get eight hours of sleep. It changes based on your genetics, light, location, and
diet.
Let’s call it six to eight hours. Twenty-four hours in a day, with eight hours of sleep, leaves
you with sixteen hours. Sixteen hours is just two other eight-hour periods, at least one of which
most people are used to working and culturally accepted as working, not including transition
time. A nine-to-five job is eight per hours a day, but they actually take an hour off for lunch, so
it’s really only a seven-hour job.
The question is, if you were willing to sacrifice all transition time and every other activity
except sleep, then you have sixteen hours to work with. Most people are used to working eight,
and they’re used to taking off Saturdays and Sundays. Your maximum hourly increase is from
eight to sixteen. We’ll just exclude transactional costs, like driving and dressing and preparing,
we just want this math to be a little easy.
You could go from the eight hours of productive output that most people have, five out of
seven days, and move it to sixteen hours of productive output, seven days a week. The math is
actually pretty simple. Sixteen times seven is 112. If you work sixteen hours a day, seven days a
week, it is 112 hours of work per week.

### Be Three Times as Effective

The math is 112 hours @ seven days a week, sixteen hours a day, versus 40 hours a week. If
you only slept and had no transitional time at all, you still cannot triple your productive hours.
It’s not possible, which is why if you want to be more than three times as effective in the world,
you need other people, or things, or ideas that aren’t you, because no matter how much you break
your own balls, you are only worth three times the hours. One could argue that immersion is
more valuable because hard ideas have start up and spool down time. Or, one can argue that
more time is less valuable, because you burn out, and you get tired of focusing on a thing. Either
way, let’s just call it about three times effectiveness based on total sacrifice of any non-


productive enjoyment. You want to watch a movie? You’re not in the movie business?
Disallowed.
You want to go outside to eat? Nope! No eating outside. As a matter of fact, no getting up
from the chair. No! It’s not that great. If you want to really make breakthroughs in this world,
you’ve got to use people that aren’t you, because you can only get about three times as many
hours.
Now, can you change behavior and do things that are better tactically and strategically? Sure,
and you should, because as said previously, more hours is only worth a maximum of about three
times. When you look at the people ahead of you in this world, three times isn’t going to get you
even close, and it almost doesn’t matter who you are.
A great example of this is trying to cook a steak by a committee where 10 people come into a
room, look at the steak and blow their warm breath on it trying to cook it. You could increase the
number of people on the committee to 100 and you still wouldn’t be reaching the temperature
that you need in order to cook the steak. You need one hot thing, not 100 warm things.

### The Critical Path

When you want to create an outcome and you’ve got limited resources, most people choose
the objective based outcome filtering of “what’s the critical path?” What’s the least number of
steps with the least amount of risk? Where we are now to where we want to be? Then you look at
where you want to be and you say, “Well, what do we want?” We want customers and we want
our customers to like us. Do we let our customers develop the product that they will fall in love
with? Yes! What’s the minimum viable product to get out the door to start getting feedback with
our case study, to start optimizing the product and make it amazing?
We already have a good product; every money value that we already spend will not only
generate the best return, because it’s the most sticky and most useful product, because it’s
already been optimized by some pre customer test cases. It’s already more reliable because we
tested it with those guys and improved it, so now the new guys get it better. It’s also because it
better enhances the likelihood that every new customer that we get tells a friend and we might be
able to get some free customers from word to mouth advertising that we didn’t have to pay for.
Those customers tend to stay longer.


The problem with that approach: the upside to that approach is that it cuts out a lot of needless
steps that would waste time and energy, and not create a better product for your customer and not
create a better market fit by choosing the right pricing, loading the scope and doing one thing
really well instead of doing ten things in mediocrity. It’s very good for those things. That way
the lean startup methodology and critical path analysis are effective in those areas. However,
there is a downside to using critical path analysis and lean startup minimum viable product style
of creation; Some of the things that you could have built that may be more profitable than the
original idea is, and you may have easily pivoted into. You never notice these things because you
filtered out and cut off the other novel and interesting things to focus on the one thing that you
decided was the most important. What you’ll find is some of the companies that are wildly
successful are wildly successful with products that were definitely not what they were originally
invented to do.
Flicker was a video game company. Then they turned into a photo company, because people
liked that more. Slack was a video game company and they turned into a product management
company, because people like that more. When you use novelty search, when you care about
bottom up, when you do what is interesting and perhaps you have enough energy to survive that
indeterminate space for longer, then you can end up with unpredicted excellent reward outcomes
that you would never have been able to find or figure out from the end point backwards style.
In summary, by choosing a destination, an outcome, and reaping the rewards of not wasting
energy falling down paths that are maybe dead ends, you have a high specificity, you don’t get
false positives and you don’t waste time. You also have a low sensitivity and you don’t capture
what you might have been able to do, and so it is the path between what you want, which is
profitability in most cases in business, and where you are now, which is the idea stage.
The point is, you might be able to create some good things in the world regarding people
making better decisions and taking responsibilities in their own lives. Use an interesting novel
search pattern, since human beings are trained to care about that stuff more than brute objectivity
anyway. You must try to optimize the objective likely, the minimum viable path to get the thing
done, because of the uncertainty in the likelihood of that path over the others. Quit wasting time
trying to optimize outcome strategically and with the concrete vision and be happier with a more
flowery “throw a lot of stuff at the wall and see what sticks” kind of style.


If you don’t do it, you don’t know it. If you didn’t build it, you didn’t invent it. Most of what
you think you have invented, you will find has already been patented by people a long time ago,
or they already tried it and it failed. For example, the human eye. We aren’t the only animals
with eyes; they’ve developed separately and unrelatedly time and time again at least 50 different
times across many different animals, because they serve a very useful purpose. For the same
reason animals developed useful eyes separately, you likely came up with a cool invention to
solve a common problem, just like everyone else did, you just know about the problem and
solving it more than you know about their attempts. Someone who spent more time reading
patent applications might have the opposite experience.
It’s easy to think that what makes a man rich is what he does. In fact, what makes a man rich
is what everyone else does; What the society you operate in allows you to own, what the judges
and lawyers will let you keep and not tax away, what good work your employees perform and
how much your customers will buy, and how many people didn’t choose to compete with you or
do the same job at roughly the same quality for free. You can’t get rich in a vacuum, unless
you’re in the space exploration business. Or thermoses.
If you’re not doing it, you don’t know it.
A lack of balance is the definition of pain.
How do you get people to focus on commonly forgotten ingredients of a successful recipe?
What is more important in a cake? The sugar, the flour, or the cooking? You need them all, or
you don’t get a cake. By this analogy you can see that a successful person such as Bill Gates isn’t
wealthy solely because he started a business. He’s wealthy because he started a business and the
entire world bought his products. When you see that it is the world and its systematic behavior
that causes things to happen, then you can understand better that a different human Bill Gates
would have performed the same task perhaps at a different time. There has to be some merit in
shifting the focal point externally.
If you’re a seduction-ist and you have the normal training, it is very self-centered and not
system oriented, the same way that many self-help and personal development materials are.
When you include your relationship to the system and their relationship to the system, you can
save a lot of time when you’re not swimming against the current. Egocentrism is one of the
lowest forms of understanding.

# RESPECT

This chapter is better called “Respect” if you’re used to being subordinate (as in giving
respect to another), and better called “Influence” if you’re in a position of having more power
than those around you (as in having influence). Basically the chapter is, for better or worse,
named based on the situation you find yourself in. In order to be respected, other conscious
actors need to be aware of you. However, you can be influential and anonymous, or even
influential and hated and disdained. It’s a rather hard chapter to name universally.

## Market Yourself

### Product Development Beats Sales

The winners of the world aren’t known for going out there saying the same stuff over and
over again to people and optimizing for their response, because these people shouldn’t be
optimized for. These might not be the best people of the world. You’d much rather be in an
environment where people are preselected to like you because they knew who you really were,
were proud of what you really did, and wanted to be around you—not for your act, not what you
wish you were, or what you convince people what you are, but what you actually are. The thing
that took effort that didn’t have anything to do with them, and the more time you spend on
yourself improving the world and improving your impact, the less time you spend on others. It’s
the difference between product development and sales.
You could scam someone into buying nearly anything, and in the end, you’d be a scammer.
Or, you could build the best product that anyone has ever seen and it would sell itself without
you saying a single word. You could beg them not to buy it and they’ll beg to pay you double
because you’ve built the best product that they could find. That’s a choice you have to make. Do
you want the short-term success of actually hurting a product and perhaps the people that spent
their hard earned money on it? Do you think going out, staying out late, and drinking alcohol


while doing silly stuff and risking bar fights and all that, helps to develop your product? No. As a
matter of fact, anyone who knows that your lifestyle is composed primarily of those things will
look down upon you as someone that is less valuable, more risky, and a waste of time.
Popularity (friend count) for a proxy measurement of beauty until the machine learning can
properly identify it. It could be difficult to detect if someone is soon to be single, more machine
learning is needed perhaps.
Find beautiful people who don’t go out (search old yearbooks, where’d they go?).

### Personality

There’s power in admitting you’re wrong, and it’s so rare these days that it’s very notable.
Displaying weakness is rare unless you’re baiting.

### Being Nice

It is a random function with lots of noise as to whether being nice works out better than being
not nice. The Neanderthals and dodo birds didn’t seem to fare well. Hell, there’s all kinds of
things which aren’t around anymore. Sometimes there can be only one survivor, and sometimes
you can have lots, and because chance exists, you can’t really know which path is right with
absolute certainty.

### Photos...............................................................................................................................

When taking photos for social media, do what the underwear ads and other ads do, if you can
execute it well. Don’t look into the camera, have the right lighting, perhaps a good sunset, etc.
Make sure you have a wide-open aperture. You could do it in the teenage style and throw some
friends in who are having fun and smiling. Influence is only as good as the objectives of its use.

### Dancing

If you have a great body, dancing makes you hotter, and if you wear different or crazy
clothes, it makes you cooler. If you are captain of the football team and great looking, and you
stalk a girl with binoculars through her window, you’re cute. If you’re fat or ugly or both, any of
these odd behaviors will amplify the degree that people dislike you. Imagine what a fat person


looks like walking down the catwalk at a fashion show. Now imagine what the models looks
like. How often do you see fat people on the cover of magazines not called, “Fat Persons
Weekly”? Great fashion on bad bodies if prevalent enough will cease to be fashionable. That’s
why clothing brands are sometimes paying certain people to stop wearing their clothes.

### Fashion

Popped collars and spiky hair provide for your body a texture that you would look
individually at a material to find. So, popped collars and spiky hair and the three-dimensionality
that comes from it look good at the scale of a human. Adding a little bit, of extra volume in
different directions makes for a more definable image and sharper edges, things that are
attractive.
On the smaller scale, that’s what you do to a material to make it more beautiful, you texture it.
Starch your collars to give a shape to your upper body, which can really get any other way if
you’re human.

### Grooming

#### Smelling good

If a person’s hair smells bad and sweaty, imagine how the rest of them smells. Don’t be that
person.

#### Eyelashes

```
slate-950 creates contrast and makes eyes whiter.
```
#### Eyebrows

In order to impart emotion, you really have primarily your eyes, eyebrows, mouth, lips and
the angle of your head. This is why eyebrow trimming can be so useful to your face. It’s always
expressing your emotions on your behalf. You get the most bank per inch of hair trimmed here.
For a small amount of time and discomfort, you can have a more open, appealing and emotional
look. Maybe you’re lucky and you have a uni-brow across the top. You get super bang for the
buck by making two eyebrows out of that thing. You’ll have to spring for a replacement for your


caveman costume at Halloween though. For you gentlemen out there, if you remove too much
hair, you’re going to first look too girly, then like the Mona Lisa.

The Mona Lisa has no eyebrows; however, she sure does have some dark shadows where
those eyebrows would be if she had.

#### Pubic Hair (or Lack Thereof)

```
Funny, the pubic lice don’t have anywhere to live these days.
```
### Your Image.......................................................................................................................

Don’t make jokes too good at your expense.
If you’re funny and creative and you make too much fun of yourself, the dumb-dumbs around
you will just chant your once original joke over and over till you wish you didn’t make it.

## Marriage

### Prenups

People that don’t have prenuptial agreements, get divorces. And the reason is if you give
someone a million dollar reward for thinking you’re not funny or cool to hang out with anymore.
Scivive will tell you, for a million dollars it’s very easy for people to fall out of love with you,


for a million dollars it’s very easy for people to think that you’re just not that cool anymore. You
could be the funniest guy in the world. And if there’s a million-dollar payoff for not laughing at
your jokes that million dollars are going to get paid. Don’t structure the underlying agreements
and mutual beliefs in a way where the parties have a reason to have sex.

### One Should Not Set a Tactic as a Goal

Marriage is a way to amplify enjoyment in life. Some marriages are wonderful, some are
deadly. To be clear in one’s objectives is to hit the mark much easier. Many the married person
would be better off finding a new person to enjoy marriage with, than fight desperately to not be
in something new. Thus it’s not the staying in a situation that’s important, that’s but a means to
an end. That being said, flexibility is nice, and if you have more paths to happiness and fewer
paths to sorrow, you are likely to be happier. Don’t sweat the small stuff, and it’s all small stuff
the saying goes.

### Kids

What’s right for the future of the word is often is wrong for us individually, and what’s wrong
for the future is right for us from a short term, mid term personal development. Do you care
about money, and do you care about excellence in areas that are not producing kids? If you do,
producing kids is going eat up a lot of your time, and yes, it’s going to give you fulfillment that
you couldn’t otherwise get, and yes, mid to long term it’s going to pay off great (hopefully), but
it is still a trade.

### Sperm Can Change, Eggs Can’t

Girls are born with all the eggs they’ll ever drop. Men make sperm all the time. Thus it’s
likely that changing your lifestyle has a larger effect on the man’s half of the DNA donated to the
baby than the woman’s. At best Mom could choose to drop a different egg, assuming some
accurate inventory was kept as to which eggs were where. So likely if you think the status of
your own body in fitness affects the DNA you give your kids, it’s probably more important for
the man than the woman to have the status they think will positively influence the baby. Now,


after the kid is already growing, it’s all mom; dad’s pretty much out of the game except for
making sure mom has good nutrition, rest, and mindset. Good luck with that...dads!

### DNA Tests Are Data Verification

Getting a DNA test on your kid is like making sure your data doesn’t have bit rot, you’re
literally checking the data in the kid to make sure it matches your own and what you think it
should. So a DNA test for kids are actually a raid data check for your genes. If you want to know
if your photos aren’t corrupted, you verify them. If you want to make sure your genes will go on
into the future, you have to check your kid.

## Friends

### Influence Is Only as Good as the Objectives of Its Use

The art of winning friends and influencing people is only as good as your influencing is
positive instead of evil. Maybe you’re an asshole? Then maybe the world would prefer you not
be good an influencing others. Good societies prefer that evil people remain powerless.

### Loans

You’re better off re-borrowing money owed to you, than getting it paid back, because they
think they can borrow some more, cause now you owe them, because you borrowed back money
they took from you in the first place.

### Paid Peer Group, Get Face Time with Warren Buffet

Clarity.fm, who do you think is going to give you better advice, your buddy Warren from
down the street or someone with good reviews on clarity.fm that charges 15 dollars a minute?
That’s 900 dollars an hour. Well, unless all the reviews are fake, it’s very likely the clarity.fm
person; unless of course your neighbor is Warren Buffett.

## Enemies


### Fake Friends

Half the people you think you are friends with might not actually be your friends, and in
reality, you may be overlooking the obvious signs.

### Scammers

Is a person who they really say they are? Check their old, real, printed yearbook (that you got
from someone they couldn’t get to give you a doctored one).

### Beating the Bastard Liars

Replace trust with verification. Since verification is cheap, make people prove stuff. You
want to take significance with stories, and verify the significance check you’ve written with
evidence that is randomly requested and generated. This is why timestamps work; because
editing video and graphics takes too long to do well to make it happen in a short amount of time.
You must avoid pre-playing attack; if they guess what you want then your request isn’t actually
urgent at all. It can be rainbow tabled and pre-computed.

### Quality of Life Over Time

Is it better to trick myself that I’m doing great things, when really I’m sitting uselessly on my
ass leeching the resources and productivity out of the other people in the world that actually keep
me safe, and develop the music and literature I might enjoy? And fix my teeth when they’re
rotting out of my head, only to give little to nothing back in return? Perhaps except for the
warning I leave that live truly can be wasted. And this is one way to do it, enhance the likelihood
that you do it until the day you die. Because you’ve found a way to like sucking.
Utilize magnetism or gravity if you don’t want to lose small parts while working on
something. If you’re building a computer case and you don’t want to lose your screws into it, use
magnetic tools and ferrous screws, or turn it all upside down. Then, when something falls off, it
falls out instead of in. Just watch your eyes and don’t get crushed.

## The Internet


### Scammers

Is it a trap? Has your enemy predicted your response? Scivivors may suggest that the
likelihood that a person is using advanced tactics against you gets exponentially less with every
iteration. Some made up numbers to explore the idea: 50 percent chance they’re tricking you.
12.5 percent chance they’re guessing you’ve detected the trick and will screw you on your
response. 6.25 percent chance they’re guessing you’ll know they’re deceiving you on response,
and are going to counter your counter to their counter to the original trickery. So basically you
just run a counter. Every time you run a “He knows I know” loop, the counter goes one higher,
and the likelihood that it’s actually occurring is less and less.

### Look at the Whole Picture

Look at it like this, in the universe of all things happening, what portion of that set is people
just trying to scam or deceive people? Let’s call it 10 percent for fun. Now of that 10 percent,
what portion of those scammers are actually relying on a successful program to counter those
who won’t be easily deceived for them to win? (A second-tier tactic, like blowing up the
paramedics and firemen that show up after a bombing)? Well, the answer is quite few, because
most fools fall for the original scam just fine. Thus, maybe 10 percent of the 10 percent of the
world running scams is waiting for your response. Thus only 1 percent of scammers are relying
on your successful counter to their trap, to counter your counter.

### Reloading

Scammers have a thing they call reloading, where you call everyone that has been taken by a
scam, and tell them you’re going to help them get their money back. In reality, you’re just going
to scrape whatever morsels of meat might be left on their bones, and you know you’re likely to
get them a second time because they’ve already proven themselves fools for falling for the first
scam.

### Media Bias


What kind of photo did they include of the person they’re speaking about? If they chose a
terrible, or angry photo, when more neutral photos were available, you will know tons of the
article before you even read it. The images used to show a person can be more influencing than
the words.

### Trash Talk Is Unavoidable

Do you know that person that can put out a video or be on television and doesn’t get trash
talked and insulted in comments? Not likely. Everyone gets trash talked and insulted, and I do
mean everyone, even mister Rogers. Therefore, don’t worry so much about being insulted, it’s
unavoidable.

## Goals

Influence, rhetoric, relationships, interacting with others, giving and taking direction, getting
compliance, being a leader, finding and being worthy of passionate love.

### Your Responsibilities........................................................................................................

One may watch their loved ones stop breathing over and over again while snoring, without
knowing it is hurting their health. Ignorance of this can cost someone years of life. How many
health problems do you or your loved ones have that no one has ever noticed? Ever have a
girlfriend that had interstitial cystitis, and every doctor had her taking cranberry juice and
making it worse? Doctors are human, you are human, if you’ve got anything other than totally
perfect health, Google it. Just don’t be a hypochondriac.

### Whom You Should Respect

Taking advice from a risky person is like taking risky advice from a knife juggler. Yeah, they
might be able to give you good advice, or maybe they’re already doing some bad decisions with
their knife juggling in the first place.


## Communication

### Speak at Scale...................................................................................................................

Avoid one-to-one conversations; speak at scale, pay for the scale, whatever it takes. Big
words are signaling mechanism, to indicate that you might be smart or you might like big words
too much. Maybe you’re overreaching if it’s so important to you that you use twenty-dollar
words.
Effective communication: Over-complicating things to look smart is the opposite of smart.
Use the cheaper word. It’s hard enough to get people do anything in this world, especially if one
has to Google what you have said.
Saying “thank you” and not saying “please” is a better, more effective, more efficient way to
interact with people. If your friends and people you interact with and people that you might be
asking to, or telling to, do things are so concerned that they might get fucked out of gratitude
upon completing their task they need to preemptively, contractually look at you funny and make
sure that you say “please” beforehand – they’re petty and you don’t have real trust and you don’t
care about timing or effectiveness.
The artful implementation of vulnerability where you’re not going to get the stuffing cock
block out of you, probably generates some power that can’t be had any other way.

### Know the Language

If you don’t speak the language that you must speak in order to understand a text, if authors
and speakers are using words that you can’t define and don’t know what they specifically mean
in this esoteric branch of understanding a science, you’re not going to get anywhere. You have to
stop at every sentence and go look up the meaning of the word and hope to memorize it before
you go on. You don’t get two more words until you’re hit with another word that you have no
idea what it means. The very specific meaning is the difference between understanding it or
having a chance to and completely getting it wrong and keeping it wrong because you don’t have
someone else there to show you how you got it wrong.
The point is, the same things that make a movie or story interesting, the same things that make
you click a link, the same things that make a picture that you have the picture that you saved


instead of all the other pictures that you’ve seen, if you’re not speaking in those terms which
human beings are interested by, then nearly tautologically whatever you’re doing is
uninteresting. Unless you got lucky to have become interesting by accident through achieving a
result you didn’t set out to achieve, you really should be speaking the language, the emotional,
motivational, moving, addictive, and worthy of telling your friends about language that human
beings care about. Not that they should, not that they will, but that they do care about. Whenever
you read, touch or interact with something that Scivive discusses, please make sure that you’re
speaking the language that people care to notice, care to spread and care to speak and are moved
by. Not the clinical, logical, cerebral, alien textbook style stuff that people have selected against
every single time they’ve had the ability to.

### Great Listening Makes for Great Speaking........................................................................

If you want to say great things, you need to read and hear great things. If you want to transmit
wonderfully, you must absorb wonderfully. The language and literature and the music you
absorb will color you and literally be the content you process and retransmit into the world. If
you desire happiness, observe joyous things. If you want to excel at powerful communication,
absorb powerful communication.

### Downward Intonation

Powerful and effective speakers rarely end their sentences with upward intonation. Why
would they? He-he. See what was done there? The text used a couple questions and upward
intonation to make a nice refrain from the chorus of commands.
Downwards intonation is how people know you mean business. How you say things, often
with tone, is more important than what you say. Say it like you mean it. Your subconscious is
listening to you when you speak as well, and if it hears you speak something forcefully enough,
often enough, your very identity itself will tend to merge with the speech.

### Positive and Results-Oriented Language


“Work” should be retitled to “production,” or another results word instead of the work word.
Effort isn’t what you should be focused on, this isn’t the gym, we’re not trying to stress our
system; we’re trying to effect the world, and if it comes effortlessly, then ten times better.

### Virality

“Virality” is the adjective Scivive will use for the ability of an idea or context to be spread
massively and rapidly. An analysis of images and videos with virality shows they have things in
common.

### Anthropomorphize

We’re built to deal with other thinking creatures, thus we’re likely to see thinking actors in all
things. Why not harness that common mental misconception of programming for something
good?

### Mix Up Your Tactics

Don’t use the same word twice in the same sentence, or in near proximity unless there’s a
really compelling reason to do so.

### Alliteration and Rhyming

Alliteration is the occurrence of the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or
closely connected words.
Rhyming is the occurrence of the same letter or sound at the end of adjacent or closely
connected words.
We like when two words right after each other have the same sound. Some people get mislead
when they’re creating these because how you describe something is usually more important than
what it is. Much of the great idea has been lost, because it was never described properly. What
seems like falling on deaf ears is often just a poorly delivered story. If you already have a
wonderful idea, and you can state it in a way that people understand it, then the only things you
can do to improve that idea are the artistry and feeling of the idea. If the facts are all wonderful,


then you should find the right words, packaging, analogies, similes, to make it compelling.
Which of these two true statements do you like more?
A. Eating fruit is better for your health than eating candy.
B. An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Because of the rhyme, one of these is a famous and memorable saying. The other... not so
much.

### Write Well

- Great reading makes for great writing.
- Read the greats to write like the greats.
- Don’t use complicated language.

### Large Numbers

Most people understand what a million is; it’s a lot. However, they do not understand properly
what a billion is. They don’t really understand that it’s 1,000 million. A billionaire is a
millionaire x 1,000. So Scivive is going to use the term 1,000 million instead of billion because it
has superior emotional effect.

### Meme Magic

Memes, as you know them on the internet at least, are funny, interesting, addictive ways to
see the world. Meme power is a thing, and certain groups of people try to make good memes to
spread ideas that aren’t so popular. For instance, primarily racist, bigoted, or misogynistic, ideas
that are detrimental to the world can still gain popularity this way. 4chan/pol uses “meme magic”
to try and get their ultraconservative ideas more traction, and it works. The memes can be
hilarious, and thus become viral.

### Visual Presentation

Turn everything you generate that’s a graph or text into an infographic. This can be found for
low prices and with fast turnaround time on fiver. Perhaps there’s an open source and free way to
do it as well, but for five bucks, why would you bother looking for it?

### All Conversations Usually Have the Same Form

The sooner you can identify which arguments are which, the sooner you can throw the useless
ones away, or educate the proponents that they spent time supporting X, and would serve
themselves and the world better supporting Y instead. Not all of the conversational vectors have
the same benefits or payoffs.
Changing how people feel about a thing doesn’t help them address the underlying cause. For
example, if you say to a group of people, “Someone stole my wallet.” The replies you receive
could include, “You should’ve had a chain on it, you shouldn’t have carried it, you should have
known about that neighborhood, stuff happens.” These are all not helpful. But then one actually
useful person says, “Oh yeah I saw that happen, I know that guy, he got arrested right after that,
you should go check at the police station; they probably have it.” All the other commenters were
pretty much useless dickheads compared to that last guy.


### General Argument Form

```
Something bad happened
Exception finder
You should have known
You shouldn’t be upset
You deserved it
You could have done xyz
This happens all the time
Why didn’t you do xyz
This is why we must do Q thing

### Agreeable Speech

Saving face.
Say “and” instead of “but,” even if it feels weird. It will feel better to them, and they’ll
understand what your meaning without the distrust of all words following “but.”
Feel how these sound:
“Breakfast was great, but the toast was burnt.”
Or,
“Breakfast was great, and the toast was burnt.”


Most people get upset a bit the moment they hear the word “but” because over a lifetime of
conversations, we’ve been trained that everything after the word “but” is no fun to hear.
You could play with the converse and ruin good compliments by inserting “but” in them
instead of “and.” Just to see how powerful the words are.
“You looked great tonight and I liked your perfume.” Or,
“You looked great tonight but I liked your perfume.”
Do: Remove personality. Replace “why” with “for what reasons” and don’t use the word “I.”
No one wants to be thought a fool, thus people are often slow to admit wrong doing or
thought. The less social cost and more social profit you can attach to what you’re trying to sell,
the easier a pill it will be for people to swallow. This is why it’s great to remove identity from
the issue, because then people don’t have to save face.
If you give someone the option to hide their true belief and appear smart, or be truthful and
appear stupid, it’s often more profitable for them to appear smart. Many the job and lover has
been lost over speaking the truth. Thus the truth is often less profitable than the lie, and this is the
profit you are working against, or to replace, as a truth spreader.
The more the person needs an intervention, the less likely the intervention is to work.
It’s hard to reason people out of ideas they didn’t reason themselves into. The more logical
your idea, the easier it is for logic to sway you back to straight. It’s like triage on the
battlefield—it’s much easier to repair people who are less damaged. The exceptions are beliefs
that people have, that they never really thought much about.

### IWBH

IWBH is Scivive’s acronym for “It will be hard,” and it’s the summary of all the bullshit
people waste your time with after you give them a good idea.
WAT means “What about this?” — endless distraction.
Know it alls. Being ignorant is not so much a shame, as being unwilling to learn.
Put the blinders on them.
When you say something, you set the frame. All the smart trolling repliers accept the frame
and dive right in, excluding all the better, greater ideas they could have been talking about. They
think they’re smart, but they’re not, they went for the bait.


### Categorizing Conversations by Motive and Type

In order to execute better marketing, or better understand the world, analyze each comment in
a forum thread or Reddit thread, and write the essence and the motive of each comment down
next to the post. Then you will have a rough idea or menu of the stuff you will see and need to
deal with anytime a similar topic shows up again.
Keep in mind that you usually get some Tithonous errors, and aesthetics keep the world what
they considered pretty comments, this one had an unusually amount of “Life sucks I want to die”
comments. It’s funny how obvious everything becomes when you give things a name. This is
like all the crap that people talk when you come up with a good idea and they just tell you how
hard it is, and why it won’t work, etc. Yeah, people know it’s hard, you don’t have to explain it.
Surprisingly to some, many of the things that people are told to do that are hard, when they’re
done, and they often are, turned out to not be too difficult after all.
Word breakers, these people mess up the meaning of words instead of choosing better words.

### Layne’s Law

Coined by software developer Layne Thomas, Layne's law of debate states that:
A) Every debate is over the definition of a word.
B) Every debate eventually degenerates into debating the definition of a word, or
C) Once a debate degenerates into debating the definition of a word, the debate is debatably
over. A notable example of this law may include the arguments over the definition of “assault
weapon” in the gun control debate.
Rhetorical tactics
Heads I win, tails you lose.
Truth finding.
Beat the truth out of people, tactically speaking.
If you want people to actually tell you the bad news, you need to presuppose there is some, or
they’ll just avoid it; e.g., “So what is wrong with the plane today, Captain?” Or more
specifically, “Name three things wrong with the plane today.” This is like asking for the first four
digits a of a credit card number, instead of the entire thing at once. Small hoop. Small hoop, big
hoop.


### Cooperation Tricks

Going out to eat—the 5- 2 - 1 restaurant game.
If you and a friend are trying to decide where to go to dinner, there is a fun way to assist in the
decision making process. You name five restaurants, they pick two, and you choose between
them. (5- 2 - 1 game) You can move the numbers around a bit; the key idea is that you trade
choosing back and forth from a set.

#### One Cuts, One Chooses

Divide a cake. One person cuts, one person chooses.
Two partners write down in secret what they would pay to buy the other one out. Whichever
one picks the higher number gets to keep the business.

### Punishment and Reward

#### Intermittent Reward

You can’t always punish bad behavior; you have to randomly make things good. Intermittent
reward is more addictive and interesting than being steadfast in your ways. You have to prime
the pump of good behavior.
Any time someone attempts to screw you over, or anytime a company uses advanced sales
tactics, it means they’re more likely to deceive you somewhere else. If they don’t care about you
in the small things, it’s unlikely they will care about you in the big things. Just like attempted
murder, you must punish or penalize people for attempted deceit.

### Don’t Fix. Fire.

For the same reason that we get frustrated so easily, because the solution is much more likely
to be just trying something else instead of doing the same thing for harder and longer, the
environment that we live in has never been more suited by replacing instead of fixing people.
When you have a problem or a bunch of problems with someone, you can try and fix them, and
what you will discover is that people rarely, if ever, change for the better, yet quite commonly
change for the worse. Now this might just be because you don’t care to value all of the things


that they have to change for the better, and it’s a form of confirmation bias, however in this case
that bias would be considered having high standards for what you should give a stuff about in
another person’s behavior. An employer doesn’t care if you stopped killing innocent animals in a
video game to be a nicer guy, while you are double clocking out for lunch and double clocking
back in, so that you are actually getting paid to eat lunch while everyone else you work with is
not. That’s why there is a clock on the wall there, so you only get paid for the hours you actually
work.
Thus, because of social media, the internet, and job hunting sites, etc., it’s never been easier
to find someone good and amazing to work with, that you had no idea such a person even
existed. Just like relationships. Back in the old days, everyone would get married to someone that
lived less than 15 minutes from where they grew up, because the world was literally a quite
smaller place back then. Nowadays, we have so much exposure to the entire rest of the planet
that you would think everyone in the world had 6-pack abs, because that’s all you see on
magazines and Instagram.
The key to firing instead of fixing workers is that you must have a constant lead flow, or
ability to replace in a timely manner. The fewer options you have, the stuffier your life will be,
because when people know you have no or few options, they treat you worse. When you fire
over fix as policy, the people you interact with will treat you better than they would if you didn’t.
It gives them a real tangible profit to treating you well that unconditional lovers can’t offer.
Unconditional love makes people feel like they’re not getting paid for their work. People hate not
getting paid for their work.

### Enemies

Internet trolls (thought vandals). Verbal bullies.
Significance driven people who are happy to create pain. Usually those who wish to harm
others are executing a strategy with the subconscious motive that they wish to be treated better,
whether they deserve it or not. It’s like mental extortion. If they don’t get treated the way they
want, they’ll hurt you. “That’s a real nice mood you have there, it would be a shame if something
were to... happen to it.... Right?”

### Getting to the Truth


[XYZ country you’re in] girls know how to treat their boyfriends right; they never break up.
“How long have you been with your boyfriend?” This gives them a compliment if they admit
they have a boyfriend. You want to presuppose the worst case and give them a benefit for
admitting it. They’re smart. They know that the second someone detects that they’re not in the
market for some afterhours loving, the conversation is over. When the only thing you have to
offer is your body, and it’s not on offer, people get out of there real quick. So they avoid letting
you know that your only use to them is to entertain them while they burn some time before they
go home to lay with their boyfriend. Get your tap dance shoes on!

## Romance

### Choose Your Life

```
Are you looking for?
```
- New relationships.
- Better sex.
- Lots and lots of sex.
Lonely? Be amazing and see how long you can stay lonely.
On a long enough time scale, nothing escapes the odds. If you’re a giant loser, make it a
mission to see how worthy you can become, without still getting a woman, and you’ll find the
world isn’t stupid, and if you’re attractive, people will be attracted to you. This goes almost
without saying, but some people are so far demoralized that they can’t see the obvious truth of it.

### You Make Your Own Romantic Destiny...........................................................................

There is no giant conscious 3rd person eyeballing your relationships to make sure they meet
their needs for what they want to see happen in the world, and thus fulfill the “destiny” they have
created for you. In fact, there’s not a single entity out there trying to achieve to some state of the
universe that has you with a single other person. In fact your destiny is created by two people,
you and your lover. You both create each other’s destiny through will and practice, and there
need not be any third voyeur whose objectives are more important than your own.


Your vision of the future and your ability to create it with the people you love is the highest
and best destiny this world will know.

### Pickup Artists Aren’t Fulfilled, They’re Empty

If you analyze the lives of successful pickup artists, you won’t find a whole lot of happiness.
The problem with getting addicted to a time consuming game, where 90 percent of the time
you’re not having fun, or at least complaining quite a bit, is that you create a hole in your life,
where no matter how may lovers you get, it’s never enough.
In the hunt to be with others, you may never feel more alone. When you put yourself out
there, and expose yourself to the world, you’re going to suffer many insults. That is the barrier to
entry that will allow you to do what others only dream of. If everyone else had the balls that you
do to say hello to people you find interesting, and improve yourself relentlessly, then there would
be little profit in it, for everyone was doing it. You would need to do all those things just to break
even. Lucky for you, you live in a world full of people living below their potential. Lucky for
this book too, for if everyone was already perfect, there would be little need for a book of
excellence.

### Talk of the Trade

```
IOI: Indicators of interest
EC: Eye contact
BFF: Big fat friend
Set: Group of people
In set: gaming in a group of people
Bounce: go to next club
Eject: leave the set
Neg: calibrated indicator of non-interest
Alpha: Leader of the pack
Spin Plates: Have a few girls you are romantically involved with at once.
Cougar: 30+ year old woman who is sexually active / predatory
Mixed set: group with guys and girls in it
```

AMOG: Alpha male other guy
Bitch shield: Acting unsocial by default
One-itis: Being overly concerned with a single romantic interest
3 - second rule: If you see something you want to open, go now and do it.
Hired guns: waitresses, promoters, strippers, models.
LMR: Last minute resistance. You’re in bed naked, but she doesn’t want to play. Hide the
salami.
AA: approach anxiety
Blow out: fail out of set with low value
Stall out: run out of material
Genpop: general population, not the VIP area
Humble brag: Displaying value without looking like that is your intent.

### Calling Out Locations

If you are out with a wing, you’re going to be calling out positions quite a bit, so you should
have a communication strategy, like “Check your 6,” = “Look behind you.”

### Look Great

Stop eye-balling everyone
They can’t look at you when you’re staring at them. They can’t absorb your style and become
attracted, when they’re too scared to look, because if they even come close to looking your
direction, you’ll lock eyes with them and make them feel weird.

### Shut Up About Your Problems

You’re supposed to be the path to value, not the path to suffering. No health problems, weird
issues, no problems of any kind should be discussed, unless you’re humble bragging.

### Privacy Is Profit

We’ve evolved to be private, so that people see the best sides of us. No one posts their worse
selfies, for everyone’s idea of who you are, is actually only what they’ve seen of you. Thus,


control their image of you, and you change who you are to them in their reality. Their reality is
the most important thing they know.
Fakeness and privacy don’t seem that important to anyone until they are stripped of them.
Imagine a world where hiding your body is illegal. Imagine a world where there can be no
private conversations. No more makeup, no more clothing, and all phone logs, emails, and mail
are to be made public and tied to your identity. Ok, so now what does the world look like? Girls
all of the sudden look quite odd. Less red in the cheeks, more little red dots. Makeup, fashion and
social media are like professional wrestling on television, they’re fun to watch, and not real.

### Meeting Great People You Don’t Know

Some of the principles here aren’t applicable outside cold approach. If you’re in a big group
that went to the VIP together and you’re already interested in one of the girls with you there,
then you are already warm, you’re not doing cold approach.
What does great look like?

### People to Be Wary of

#### Drama Queens

Drama queens might not be able to find significance by being prettier or smarter, but they can
hurt your feelings, and through being able to cause you that pain, become quite important to you,
and themselves. For only they could be begged to stop hurting you right?

#### Outliers Gonna Lie

The crazier the hair and face piercings, the crazier drama you’re likely to get. If you’re willing
to do more adventurous things to your body, you’re probably more likely to do more adventurous
things with your behavior. What could be more adventurous than taking a bunch of dangerous
pills and calling your boyfriend to tell them about it, or hurt themselves and tell people their
boyfriend did it, or even perhaps poison you or otherwise exact revenge over something
prematurely?
Can you still find your fair share of drama from normal looking people? Yep, you’re just
playing the odds. If you like kinky sex, weirder piercings tattoos and hair also increase the


chances they’re down for that too. Adventurous people rarely restrict the boundary breaking to a
single domain.

### Go Where You Fit In, and People Will Like You More.....................................................

If you’re the only white guy at a slate-950 club, and you happen to meet a few of the only white
girls at the slate-950 club, you’re likely to discover they’re there because they prefer dating slate-950
people, which is why they’re at the slate-950 club. The same goes for most other heavily minority
clubs. People go where the music and crowd is what they like, and if you’re not similar to the
people in that crowd, you’re likely to be shunned. If you’re the guy wearing a 3 piece suit at a
nude beach, it’s likely to be frowned upon. Respect people’s preferences and put the odds in your
favor.

### Walk Faster Between Clubs

Reduce your transition time. Moving sets don’t work well and if you’re in the streets moving
sets are all that’s there.

### Attracting Great People

When you are attractive, people want to say yes to you before they even know what the
question is.

### Opening

If you look at what you’re talking about, instead of the listener’s face, it lends authenticity to
your comment being genuine, and not just an excuse to talk to her. If you don’t face her like your
dinner, then she might think you’re making a funny passing comment, and not trying to hook up
with her. Guys that try to hook up with her are lower value than the guys that she can only
admire from a distance, because they don’t care about her.
When you give away your liking of someone without effort, you rob them the opportunity of
earning it and being proud of the achievement.

### Time Wasters....................................................................................................................


If you’re interesting and fun, who wouldn’t want to talk with you? Thus, once your game is
on point, you need to make sure that the people who you are gracing with your presence are
worthy. Worthy could be defined as Brain, Money, Pussy, Giggles. What else matters? The brain
and money is only as useful as it leads to the Pussy and Giggles. You could even call the pussy a
subset of giggles. Here’s how you separate the worthwhile from the time wasters.

### Bad Sets

It’s very difficult if not impossible to unburn toast. It may be equally difficult to reliably
defeat the heavyset overprotective friend or the “Mother Hen.”

### Now You’re in Set

Do not pull your phone out in order to look cool or appear busier than you are, it never works.
Showing someone cool photos that have nothing to do with you doesn’t work either. Sharing
funny YouTube videos with people while you’re in the club is not the way to be attractive. Leave
the phone in your pocket, and just be yourself.
One hard thing, two easy things. This is similar to 2 steps forward, one step back. It’s why
prices end in 9’s. They’re harder to add up and see how far you’ve come.
Don’t ask for compliance you’re not going to get, or you’ll get a “State break.” If you get a
compliance failure, it’s bad, really bad. Once people are used to saying no, you’re screwed.
Positive momentum relies on getting no rejections.

### Avoid the VIP...................................................................................................................

Avoid hunting in the VIP section in case the VIP area is actually strict about entry. Girls don’t
buy bottles or have tables at the VIP, it is only the guys. Since the only girls in the VIP were
invited there by other guys, you’re much better off working in general population because you’re
more likely to find a girl or two that isn’t already locked into set with an army of bros willing to
waste money and attention on them.
While in the club, girls in the loudest area in the middle of the dance floor don’t want to chat.
Girls at the end of the bar looking down it long ways are usually interested in the staff, and won’t
burn that dream to hook up with anyone that’s not staff there.


### Dancing Amplifies Your Body

Dancing amplifies your body. If you are dancing and your body is in bad shape, now you look
worse. If your body is good, and you dance well, now you look better. Most people that have
problems with girls don’t have good bodies. Off the dance floor game is a safer bet than on the
dance floor, as far as opening goes.

### The Next Morning

You’re going to have things stolen. Sometimes on accident, sometimes on purpose. Glasses
are going to break, people are going to bleed on your furniture, and random underwear will
appear in places they obviously don’t belong.
Depending on how much you drank, the person you’re with might look quite different from
what you remember. The light of morning can make someone look very different from the lights
in the club, especially now that you’re semi-sober.

### End Game

If you like saving money on your taxes, maybe getting married is an option for you. Get a
prenuptial agreement. Good paper makes good friends. If someone has a million-dollar reason to
not think you’re funny anymore, you’ll discover that you get a lot less laughs. Aligning
incentives works great. If you want to blow up your marriage, just keep stacking rewards for it to
end. If you want your marriage to last, then stack rewards that make lasting profitable.

### Phone Numbers

Do you like wasting your time? Then definitely think phone numbers are useful. The only
thing that is useful is attraction and thus compliance. If you don’t have compliance, your phone
call will be unanswered. If she’s not attracted, and answers anyway, you’re just going to be
wasting your time.

### Hollering at Women in the Street


Stop. It does not work. It has never worked. You are raising the woman’s shields and ruining
the peacefulness of public places everywhere. When the inevitable happens, and whatever you
hollered doesn’t have any positive effect, do you yell out something like “BIIIIITCH” or
“LESBIANS”? Go home, beat yourself with a stick for a while, and never do that again. What if
every store you visited yelled some expletive insult at you when you left without buying
something?

### Calibrated Negs

If you neg too hard, they don’t care to buy value back from you with good behavior. Negs are
only as useful as they change your targets’ behavior. The neg strength needs to match the target.

## Girls Vacation Where the Guys They Want to Have Sex With Live

If you know a girl that is learning Spanish, and likes to vacation in Spain, she probably loves
Spanish men. If you know a Dutch girl, and she loves vacationing in Curacao, she probably
prefers slate-950 lovers. Girls aren’t stupid, they like boys and prefer to be around the ones they find
more attractive rather than less.

## Terrain Awareness: It Takes Tons of Dirt to Find a Fleck of Gold

If you froze time, took all the girls in the club, lined them up in a row in front of you, and then
started separating them out by their objectives with sex as your filter, here’s what you might see:
Out of 100 girls, let’s just take the 90 ugly ones, make a giant clothed human centipede with
them for giggles for when they wake.
Now you’ve got 10 girls left. Let’s look at their motives first.
Let’s remove the ones who have boyfriends. Ok, now you’ve got four left. Now let’s remove
the ones on their period, girls spend about 25 percent of their life on their periods, so now you’ve
got 3 girls left. Now with the three girls that are left, you get to see which one isn’t locked into
set with 7 friends that are like crabs and grab her arm as soon as you try to take her to the bar.
Then you’ve got the other dudes that have solid game already working to do the same thing
you are, assuming she didn’t already get to the club with them. Then there’s the ones locked into
the middle of the dance floor, all facing each other. It is not recommended that you try and dance


in the middle of a group of strangers for an unknown amount of time, at some point you’ll be
told to leave the area, non-verbally.
Or you could wait by the ladies room, or at the bar, etc., basically the game is hard, and out of
100 girls, you might not get a single actually down to lay with you.
We didn’t even actually filter out all the other bullshit, such as doesn’t like whatever color
you are, has too many face tattoos and piercings, or actually wants to spend time with a friend
from out of town, etc. Now you begin to see how hard the numbers game is, so if 100 girls won’t
do the trick, and the bar only seats 5 0 , I guess you’re going to have to go to lots and lots of clubs.
You ever notice no pretty girl goes to a bar or club alone? If by chance you do run into it, you
are so lucky! Easiest fun you will ever have! They’re perhaps less than 1 out of 20 of the girls
you’ll hook up with. If you prefer cougars, you might have a higher ratio.

## Know Your Enemy—Most People Are Wastes of Time

The heavyset, overprotective friend, unless turned, is definitely your enemy.
The arm yanking person whose only mission is to make sure your conversation ends, is your
enemy.
The dumb guys yelling dumb stuff at girls, raising their shields are usually the enemy as well.
There are really only a couple useful people in the club. Your wingmen, the staff that likes
you, your target, and girls who find you interesting, and are down to do more than waste your
time. You only have a few hours to get the job done. You don’t have time to go milling about.

## Drinking and Talking Too Much

Many of the good sets have been lost to over drinking. If you’ve got it in the bag, slow down
with the drinks. Just like getting a yes to a sale, shut the heck up. No more talking. You can’t get
any more sold, but you can mess it up quite fast. You lose way more points with a single misstep
than you gain with several good plays.
The clubs are there to make money, so spend money, unless you like being barred entry.

## Queueing


Unless you happen to be queueing directly next to a hot fun girl, it’s a giant waste of time. If
you don’t need to queue for drinks, don’t. If you don’t need to queue for entry, don’t. Waiting in
queue next to non-targets is a giant waste of time you could be spending opening, or getting on
the next club.

## The New Club Always Beats Waiting

If you’re going out early, go to the stuffier clubs first. It’s better to save your best hunting
ground for when it’s the busiest than go too early and then have to move on to crappier clubs
because if you’re not in set, you keep moving! You don’t gain any value staring and scanning the
club like a predator, you lose it. So get in and open, it works well or it don’t, usually it don’t,
keep moving! When it works, stay!

## The Imaginary Land Where Naturals Don’t Game

This is similar to the world where girls don’t care what they look like. Girls that you think
don’t care, do care; and guys that you think don’t game, game. They may not know what they’re
doing, but upon closer analysis you’ll see they’re doing lots of things right they might not notice,
but you do.

## Non-Verbal Signaling

Don’t lean in, don’t turn towards the set, be body rocking out. If it seems sensible, you might
have some place to go.

## Cold Approach Pickup Is Harder 90 Percent of the Time

Depending on how you define “difficult.” If you go out 10 times and get laid one time, and
getting laid is pretty much all you care about, then it could be said that 90 percent of the time is
you saying the same things over and over again to people you wouldn’t call friends or associate
with, except for the fact that having sex with them might be fun.

## Certain Last Names Might Have Sex More Often


The most popular last name in your country, if only given by true parents, means that family
tree has the high score for having sex and surviving. To some degree you could say you’re more
likely to have kids with someone with that last name than others because they have proven to
have more than most. In some countries like Vietnam everyone just changed their name, which is
why there are so many Nguyens. But in many other countries, it’s more accurate.

## Finding Love

We care a lot about love, or at least lust.
You ever notice how many movies have a love interest in them? How about in songs? Why is
it, that even war movies shove some romance into their plots? It may come as no surprise to you
that we really care about love a lot. You see, without love, your parents wouldn’t exist. You
wouldn’t exist. Your kids wouldn’t exist either. If we didn’t take this stuff really seriously, we’d
be out of the game for good, replaced by those that did. We come into this world weak and
weary, and if we as babies weren’t supplied a breast to feed from and someone to protect us for
years, we wouldn’t survive. Few animals stay so weak for so long as we humans. Everyone is
really sensitive regarding matters of the heart.

## Only Life and Ideas Stand the Test of Time

Life and ideas have been fighting against disorder forever. Their order is how you can tell
them from the background noise of their surroundings. Their order is their identity. Think about
it.
In a thousand years, what could you build that would still be here? Two things. An idea, or
life itself. Only life has the power to maintain order and fight off the decay and entropy that is
the normal order of the world we live in. If you throw a banana in your yard, and watch it over
time, you’ll see that one day it’s not there anymore. The process of dissolving and ceasing to be
is what only life can prevent. Ideas themselves are but the inhabitants of life, for if no living
thing carries the idea, does it truly exist?

## Life Is an Idea That Carries Ideas......................................................................................


Life is a funny thing, for not only is it the only good place for ideas to live, but it is an idea
itself. Life is data. From when you were a cell in your mother and a cell in your father, to a single
combined cell, and now billions of cells. Those cells did only what they were programmed to do,
by the very long and magical strings of data inside them. You are the physical execution of the
good programming in your DNA. Ideas are carried by life, and life itself is an executed idea.
If you want to live forever, you have to create ideas or life that are strong enough to stand the
test of time. On the ideas side, you can create them solo, if you must. For the having kids though,
it’s much more fun with a partner or two. Maybe you don’t care so much about kids as a
creation, but love for its own sake. That’s great too. Let’s find you some fun partners to roll
around with!

## Play in Your League

Play in the league you qualify for. The 10s get the 10s; The 9s get the 9s. On it goes. You get
the idea. Are you a 10? Nope. A 9? Nope. Ok, so what are you? Well that depends on who’s
looking. Everyone likes different things at different times. Girls when they’re growing up might
love six packs and pretty faces. Then when they’re in their late 20s, they might like guys with
more money and class. Then when they’re in their 30s, they may go cougar mode and prefer the
young meat again. You can’t be all things to all people, and you shouldn’t want to be. You
should want to be the best you that gets what you want while still enjoying the process. You
should choose your identity, not the sea of random women you’re interested in.
Would you like to make love to 10s? Yeah, me too. As a matter of fact, who wouldn’t? Ok, so
how many 10s have you seen in person? Now you know why barely anyone gets to be with 10s.
They’re hard enough to even find in the real world, let alone outcompete the thousands of men
waiting in line or wishing to.

## Scivivor’s Love Interest Theorem (SLIT)

Like all things we understand well, we can put some numbers on it. This is the Scivivor’s
Love Interest Theorem (SLIT). The equation is simply how hot you are, times how many people
can see and respond to it, divided by your standards. That’s it.
SLIT


(Hotness x tactics) / standards = relationships
So if you increase your hotness, and you do better tactics, does that mean you will have good
relationships? Nope. Lasting relationships? Nope. Quality and durability are some of the
standards that fight against the work you did in hotness and tactics. Thus, you can only do three
things. Become hotter, make the hotness you have do better work, or lower your standards. And
one of those things sucks.

## Being the Best You

Just like discipline beats motivation, so too does personal development win over tactics.
When you are waking up next to the person you made love to the night before, the hype has
faded away, and all the cards have been laid bare on the table. What is left? What’s left is
everything that wasn’t the hype. The real you. Is this real you something you took years to refine
and be proud of? Is this real you someone others are envious of? Or is this real you a normal Joe
that used advanced tactics and effort to achieve what prettier men achieve by accident?
They both work, but one stops working when you go to sleep. The other keeps radiating. If
you’re beautiful, you’re beautiful, you are so at rest and in motion. If your attractiveness needs
you to be telling the next cool story, or showing off what you have, what happens when they’ve
heard all you have to say? Where is your cool stuff when you’re at the beach? Being an attractive
man, whether it’s through looks or personality, pays for a lifetime. It is your true identity.
Spitting game and manipulating circumstance wears off quite quickly. If you could trade all the
hours you’ve spent trying to find love, for hours spent making yourself stronger, prettier, richer,
which one would have higher and more lasting value?
When you’re done hard selling, the work you did with that one person doesn’t carry over to
the next person, you start from scratch. When you’re done hard working on yourself, that effort
lasts forever, this person or the next. You will bring you to your next relationship. Being the best
you is the strategy that makes all the tricks and tactics of conquest seem small. Now, what if you
are already deep into personal development? Well, checking SLIT since you’ve already got a big
“hotness,” you’ll get the most gains by increasing your tactics. Or, lowering your standards, but
seriously. Low standards are the father of regret.

## Working the SLIT


You could lower your standards. If that sounds good to you, put this book down, right now,
and hand it to someone worthy. This book is about getting what you want, not getting what you
don’t want.
What are these tactics of which you speak?
This is the fun stuff. As in sports, the tactical win may not last a lifetime, but damn it feels
good to be a winner.

## Fashion

At a distance, your face isn’t visible, but your clothes are. The saying, the clothes make the
man, is pretty accurate at midrange. Posture and whom you’re with matter as well.

## Three Guys Is a Crowd

PUAs are tigers, and tigers don’t do well in packs. PUAs invite you to meet other PUAs.
Normal people invite you to meet women. Two can be ok, three is a crowd.

## Pickup: Go With the Flow

When women approach you, after you’ve got significance and rapport, or if you started off
with it, try and move them away from the crowd they came from, instead of back into it. Since
they were already there, and they walked away from it, they obviously prefer not to be there, and
maybe there’s a guy she likes, or girl she hates, or too much smoke or the music is too loud, etc.
You don’t want to waste your influence points pushing them back upstream, you’ve got better
things to use those precious points for.

## Optimal Time to Go Out

A common mistake that people make is that they want to go out and meet new people on
holidays, like St. Patrick’s Day. What they don’t realize is that people start drinking early on that
day, which means they stop drinking early and it is not likely that banging random dudes is most
women’s primary goal in that day. Also, that’s when people are most likely to have set groups
that they want to hang out with and they’re not most open to meeting new people. Therefore, the
best time to meet new people is when those people are actively looking to meet new people. If


you’re trying to interject yourself amongst tight-knit groups of people who pride themselves on
excluding others, you’re going to get excluded.
Know your wing rules before you head out with your wing. A wing that blocks you is not a
wing. Introduce your wing last to the girl you want him to wing, and then his conversation with
her will be uninterrupted.
Whoever opens chooses. (They almost always choose the prettier one.)
Considering going down a point in hotness for a higher percentage chance of fun. Clawing for
every inch isn’t a great time.

## Give People Power Over You

What that really means is, give other people initial power over you so that you can have later
power over them. Their taste decides how you will dress and act, and once you meet their
subconscious desires, executing their subconscious will in the real world, you then get to have
power over them. There’s an order of operations, you don’t get to lead until you can follow. As
mentioned earlier, the best leaders are great followers, you just rarely get to see it.

## Buy Boots

Well boys, if you’ve been paying attention to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise, and all
the very successful short dudes out there—if girls want height and you want more height, well,
you better put on them boots. Thank Nicolas Sarkozy as well. Boots look cooler and they make
you taller, how can you lose?

## Wear Colors

If you dress different, get your value spike in there, so they think that you’re better instead of
worse. Unless they’re fearful, and then they’ll just not like anything different at all. It helps to
mention that there’s only texture, color, shape and pattern in regards to what you can wear. If
you don’t like it, be covered in slate-950, preferably a flat slate-950 that’s not shiny.
It’s easy to dismiss others’ problems when you haven’t walked a mile in their shoes. When
you see the Goth kids at school, and you see that one of them is sad because they didn’t get to
attend this concert for a band they really like, a band you’d pay to never hear, it’s hard to relate.


The same way it might be hard for that Goth kid to relate to a jock’s problem of fumbling the
balls, or handoff in a football play or striking out in baseball. Each of these easily recognizable
stereotypes appears to us as they do because of how they look to us, and what they appear to do
with their time. It is those very differences that cause us to group them into different categories
that are the reasons that there will be differences in meaning and respect between them. Guess
what? When people look at you, they judge you and fit you into a stereotype as well.
The great news is that you can massively influence what other people think of you, solely by
how you dress. I’ve found that it truly doesn’t cost much more to dress very, very well as it does
to dress very poorly. What great news! If you care what people think, as you very well should,
then you have power over them you may never have realized, solely by choosing the clothes that
get the job done. Buy what’s on the mannequin.
The best part of any outfit is the person wearing it.

## Appear Strong

Have you ever noticed that animals never display weakness as a strategy? Very rarely does
displaying weakness as a strategy ever happen. One can probably think of some prey animals
that have a bait hook hanging from their head in the deep sea, like crazy anglerfish and there are
probably a couple other examples, but this is nowhere near as common as faking strength.

## Be Mysterious

Mystery is power. Jesus Christ is such a powerful a figure because you don’t know what
music he liked, or what his favorite food was, or how much he slept in a night, or if he woke up
feeling quite crappy before having morning coffee.
It would be great to not dilute your social media image with mediocre content than to spam it
up and lose value. The best photographers don’t show you their “ok” pictures, so you think
they’re better than they are. If you saw all the bad photos all photographers take, you wouldn’t
think as well of them. Let what people don’t know about you speak on your behalf through what
they imagine of you based on your value spikes!

## Value Spikes


People go out to have a good time, and they like to meet other interesting and fun people. In
our best moments we can all be interesting and fun. Let your best side show and don’t emphasize
your worse sides. Let people figure out what and why you lack skill at something on their own;
no reason to shove it down their throat.
Get your value spikes in once you have presented your most attractive side, relax and let it
sink in. The more you speak to things that aren’t your best stories or points, the more likely you
are to hit a trap. You only get one point for the great things you say that they love, and you lose
5 - 10 points for everything you say that you don’t like. Because it is easier to lose points than to
win them, it’s better for them to fill in their curiosity with their own imagination based on the
couple of value spikes you’ve gotten into the conversation than it is for you to say the wrong
thing and cancel out or more all the work you did to show your best side.

## Be Attractive—Don’t Be Unattractive

Attractive people get away with a lot. The amount of points that you lose for saying the wrong
thing is tied to how much the person already likes you. If they don’t like you that much to being
with, you will lose a lot, if they are already like you a lot, you’ll lose nothing and they’ll make up
a rational reason to support you saying something that would have bothered a person who liked
you less. For instance if you love dogs, and the person you’re talking to hates dogs, if they’re not
so pretty, it’s a deal breaker, but if they are quite pretty you might say, “I understand what you
mean, yeah, dogs aren’t for everyone.” You automatically downplay the negative response to a
degree. The take away being, mistakes don’t have equal cost for prettier people. The uglier you
are, the more your mistakes cost you. Thus, if you’re not so pretty, be aware that you get one
point for saying the right thing, and lose 10 points for saying the wrong thing, so speak wisely.

## Personality

### Have More than One Style of Being

Adaptability is a good trait to have when combined with knowing your audience; but be
careful not to over-adapt to the point of being insincere. If you can act different ways, sing
different songs, make funny faces and voices, then you can act as you wish with whom you wish,
because you’ve got so many outfits you can wear. If however you’ve never imitated another


person’s voice or way of speaking, never made cool facial expressions, never done anything
exciting with your body, well then, you’re not really free, you have only one outfit to wear. If
you’re really smart, you can always pretend you’re stupider, and basically use your extra brain
horsepower to properly emulate the stupider existence. If however you are stupider, you won’t
have the option to passably act as something greater, at least not with people that can detect how
full of stuff you are.
Silence speaks louder than yammering.

## Celebrity Gossip

This can cost you your real relationships, because you’re putting your mental energy into
understanding people who don’t matter. The only value is the local value, so communicate with
local peers.

### Tribal Mentality

You need to self-adjust your expectations for the impact that you’re going to make in regards
to the people that you’re speaking to. Not based on how smart and badass you are, because your
smartness and your badass line of arguments and your correctness means nothing in the eyes of a
person that can’t see that wavelength. How right and amazing you are, and all these great points
you have, literally just means the opposite to those people that look at you like an outsider, like
an alien, who are measuring who you are to them instead of what you’re saying.

### Arguing Just to Argue

There are people in this world that will see you as a threat to their importance and their
significance. These people don’t give a crap about the validity or accuracy of what you’re saying
because the entirety of your existence to them is as an outsider, as a competitor for resources.
They are engaging in the practice of trying to make you seem less important to their group by
making you seem wrong. Whatever they can say and whatever they can do to seem more
important to their group, they will do. This will happen regardless of whatever fanciful,
advanced adhesion to logic that you have because you care about logic a lot, you’ve memorized
all these fallacies and spent all these years learning. Whereas these guys, they care that the


people that they live and work with like them and that’s the end of their caring. He doesn’t really
care so much about epistemological truth, and the hunting of it, and ultimate knowledge.

### Mensa Sucks

If you’ve been looking for a better peer group, and you should always be, Scivive would
suggest that you do not try Mensa, the “the high IQ society.” What you will find in Mensa is
people that are entirely wrong about things, but wrong about them in a slightly more
sophisticated way. That is not that useful. It’s better to find people who are actually right,
particularly those who are right about things most people are wrong about. In this case, the
accurate people are often powerful and often wealthy, because when everyone else is wrong and
you’re right, you get exponentially rewarded. Conversely, when everyone else is right and you’re
right, there’s no reward whatsoever. Value is in indirect proportion to availability. When
rightness is easily available from all kinds of places, no one will pay you for it, but when you’re
the only one that knows a thing that everyone else has got wrong, they will pay you dearly, and
often times not even because they want to. If you’re on the right side, and everyone else is on the
wrong side, you’re going to be paid a multiple for the privilege of being right when everyone
else is wrong; that’s great!

#### My Experience With Mensa

I’ve only tried it a couple of times, I don’t have a large enough sample set to say it
realistically, so I’ll just reiterate what I’ve said previously; if you’re so deprived of a social group
to cohere with, and to be effective in the world through mission and shared desire and shared
interest, then you have defaulted to pretending that a high score on a dubious test is somehow
magically an interest on its own. I assure you that it is not. Your ability to understand things
speaks nothing to the application of that ability. If you have the ability to learn a new language,
and you never learn it, then when some other guy joins Mensa and wants to speak to you in that
language, you aren’t going to understand it. You’re but in the club, you both passed the test. One
guy learned another language, the other guy didn’t.

#### Being Smart Doesn’t Mean You’re Useful


Now they can’t communicate with each other in that cool language. By the way, English is
awesome. Learn it. It’s really cool. English contains the most words! And the most papers, the
best music, and the best songs. Mensa. I’ve never had good luck with it. I find that you are able
to remain stupider for longer by having a more advanced strategy and tactic to avoiding
compelling argument, which is weird, because you would think that only the acceptance of
compelling argument may cause someone to be smart in the first place.
Take a guy like Ben Stein. Ben Stein, really smart guy; really wrong about almost everything.
How does that happen?

### Knowing the Truth of Those Around You

Trust is weakness, verification is strength.
It would be great to do real fact verification on people that are commonly full of stuff. In a
world where it’s never been cheaper or easier to actually verify things, when someone talks stuff
about what they’ve done, or who they know, or otherwise attempt to steal significance for
themselves from you with fancy statements, it’s nice to verify them on the spot or let them know
that without verification, you don’t believe a word people say.

## Impact

### Impactful Professions

The professions in which you can create massive impact to the world without the help of
others are pretty limited in quantity. Writers, inventors, scientists, authors, artists, musicians,
mathematicians, programmers, biologists. Now of those professions, which are truly solitary in
nature? Perhaps the most solitary in order would be author, mathematician, artist, and inventor.
Musicians, scientists, programmers, they often work in groups. Even in the case of the author,
artist, musician, what use is your work if it’s never seen or heard? Who will carry your work to
the masses? You see, to make an impact on this world, you’re almost always going to need some
other people’s help.
Thus, there is an optimal order of operations. The goal is to take advantage of the things
which can make massive and important impact in this world, which all involve people that aren’t


you. The sooner you can enlist those people into your efforts, the sooner you can start marking a
difference.

### Unsuccessful People Telling You How to Be Successful

People who offer courses on “Personal development will make you rich!” when the first
money they ever made in their entire life was the money they made telling you that they would
make you rich, are thieves of the worst kind. They should know that you can easily look in their
history and see they have no business experience whatsoever and no success anywhere else. It
would be interesting to see what percentage of successful self-help authors were ever considered
successful before their book on success.

### “Thought Leaders”

So-called thought leaders are able to be thought leaders for the most part because they failed
so hard, so long and were content with having no standards, and making no money to stay in the
game with a very low rate of success. While all the “winners” are out there seducing the prom
queen and driving around their Ferraris, and somebody needs a comment on something, the “low
standard” guys are able to answer the phone and say “Oh yeah, I can give you an opinion on
that,” because they’re just sitting with their thumb up their ass with nothing better to do. That’s
why some believe we have such a low quality of thought leaders in America; it’s because you
got to have low standards to be around to answer the call to get the job.

### Nash Equilibrium..............................................................................................................

Maybe that concept of not everyone being able to do a thing is like the Nash Equilibrium:
“A stable state of a system involving the interaction of different participants, in which no
participant can gain by a unilateral change of strategy if the strategies of the others remain
unchanged.”

### Relationships

```
You make your destiny.
```

There is no giant conscious third person scrutinizing your relationships to make sure they
meet their needs for what they want to see happen in the world, and thus fulfill the “destiny” they
have created for you. In fact, there’s not a single entity out there trying to achieve to some state
of the universe that has you with a single other person. In fact, your destiny is created by two
people, you and your lover. You both create each other’s destiny through will and practice, and
there need not be any third voyeur whose objectives are more important than your own. Your
vision of the future and your ability to create it with the people you love is the highest and best
destiny this world will know.

### Game Mechanics

Don’t open moving sets.
For those of you out there that are doing street game, day game, night game, nightclub game
etc., if you followed the advice of Scivive, you wouldn’t be opening moving sets, because they
are terrible. Thus, if you’re not opening moving sets then there’s no reason for you to spend a lot
of time in transition. Get on your bicycle, or jog, or whatever your thing is, get the out of
transition and get into the club.

### Text Game

Getting dates after good texting.
“I would never invite a strange blonde girl from the Internet to such an awesome event, but I
think I might make an exception for you. I’m not even going to tell you what it is unless the
timing works out. When exactly can you be free this week?”
Tips: change the hair color on an emoji to match the girl. Use two dots to create a feeling of
incompleteness they want to fix by responding.

### Burn Your Value for a Friend

If you’re ever looking for some game theory strategy to burn all of your personal value, and
give it to someone else—let’s say some girl really likes you, but you’re already occupied. You
want to try and shift that girl’s interest to your friend, who’s worthy of it, and she just needs to
switch, because it works out better for everybody. You could say “Hey, come over to my friend’s


house, it’s really important that you act cool though, don’t mess this up for me.” That phrase,
“Don’t mess this up for me,” one hundred percent burns all of your value, and gives it to that
other person, so it’s an interesting tactic.
People hate from a distance, but love if they think they can align with you. There’s nothing as
cringe worthy as losers who are arrogant. I once saw a fat, balding man in a pickup class go up to
a hot bartender, ask for a pen, then tell her to write her phone number down. People that lie to
sew, I’d see how they can get away with it.
On the Internet, they call it being dragged down to someone else’s level, and getting beat with
experience; that’s the reason why you don’t argue with trolls on the Internet. They will drag you
down to their level and they will beat you with experience. It’s like wrestling a pig in the mud.
You don’t like it, but the pig thinks of it as fun.
In summary, if you want to have a better time of life, try not to always seem right. Nobody
likes it, nobody will pay you for it, and there’s a very small subset of people in this world that are
actually able to make money on being right. The less arrogant you are about it, the more of a
positive impact that you’re going to make in the world. This is because other people take the
other side of the equation, even if they’re wrong, just to not be on your side because you may
have a personality, which is so off-putting.

### Nit Pickers

Everyone likes to feel important and intelligent. One path to obtaining this goal is to find
unique or novel opinions or angles that others haven’t expressed, and express them yourself. If
you are amongst good company, and they notice, you should derive benefit. There is a common
and unfortunate side effect to this behavior of being novel, as some people in their hunt for
importance become nit pickers. Nit pickers don’t bring meaningful contribution to a
conversation, as they’re too busy pointing out the obvious exceptions that everyone else already
knows about and purposely didn’t mention; they were under the assumption that everyone else
already knew those exceptions existed without needing mention.
For instance, “But Richard, surely some nit pickers bring meaningful contributions...”
“Surely you don’t mean all the nit pickers...”
A wonderful discovery—when people say “everyone,” what they almost always mean is
“almost everyone.” Exception hunting is the weakest and most time wasting way to try to add to


a conversation. Unless the exception you’ve pointed out is hard to see, please don’t insult the
intellect of those you are speaking with by pointing out the obvious.
The reason people hate vanity and hate conceited people is because it’s harder to extract
significance from them, and harder to extract love from them. It is because of their heightened
effort and status on themselves that they care much less about you, and therefore it’s harder to
find synergy with them.

### Familiarity Preference.......................................................................................................

People tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them.
Delay forever, if possible, what it is that you do for a living or as a hobby, for no matter how
great your reality is it won’t match up to their imagination.

### Type Testing and Romance Novels

Women test for strength. The man who can actually save them is the man who can actually
hurt them. It’s good for them to sense that strength, maybe through lifting them up, maybe
through them conquering another man in front of them. Check out the covers of all the romance
novels; jacked dudes with pants half unzipped, towering above the woman they are carrying. All
the covers are identical - long hair, glistening body, stronger and taller than the woman, with a
mountainous background, the hero staring into the woman’s eyes, or sometimes not appearing to
care too much, and other times, obviously in love. If you are optimizing your identity for people
with this type of taste, one can imagine you’re doing yourself harm.
Do you see the romance cover where the man is smart, or funny, or doing something useful
like building something, or is leading other men? Nope. Is there ever modernity? Why are they
set somewhere that is surely not the world we live in?
Mind you, not all women like these books, however, you may find it odd that there is literally
no male version of this. Can you imagine if there was a male version of a romance novel with
half naked, beautiful women on the front on their knees, linked by a chain? Society would
quickly outcast such a distasteful work. Maybe pornography magazines are the one exception.
Pornographic magazines could be the male version of romance novels. Maybe they’re worse.


The problem with them is that the women are often objectified as having no traits at all except
attractiveness and nudity.

### Value

Guys who focus on getting women instead of becoming more powerful, shirk their
responsibility and the very thing that the women are selecting for. If you spend your time not
focusing on a woman and developing the traits that they select for, then against your best efforts,
they’re going to hunt you out, find you, and choose you over other people. But if you’re a man
who’s always searching and hunting and turning through leads, that activity makes you less
valuable, less useful to the other party, and if it’s not easy enough to visualize, then you could
invert it and see it from their perspective. What would a woman appear to be to you, if all they
did was sacrifice what you were selecting for? What if they got uglier and uglier the more they
went out from lack of sleep and consuming too much alcohol? Then you would look at them like
they were idiots, because they sacrificed what you were selecting for, which was beauty.

### Attraction Isn’t a Choice, Vanity Is Love

“If attraction isn’t a choice, then vanity is love.” When you are at the gym, you are actually
having sex with yourself, but wait, that doesn’t make any sense. Well, it may, because whatever
development you get there, some other partner will eventually notice and choose you for that,
and may not have picked you if you didn’t have that progress. Therefore, when you are
improving yourself and working out, mentally, physically, financially, you are actually having
sex with yourself through proxy that actually hasn’t detected the improvement yet, but will when
given the chance. Anytime you are improving yourself you are getting laid, but in the future.

### It’s Just Like Bitcoin

It’s just like Bitcoin. We burn electricity to prove that we really cared to create this answer, it
really took time and therefore it is not fake. If you don’t do the burning, then you don’t prove the
caring. You don’t prove the effort. That’s why women want real wedding rings. They may not
want the real wedding ring, because of the sparkle. What’s important is that it cost you greatly,
because you can fake words, you can fake some actions, but you cannot fake a year’s worth of


working salary to buy a girl a gold ring. It’s a way for her to learn that if you have a kid together,
and that kid’s a crying mess, that you’re dedicated and are still going to be around. The purchase
of an expensive ring is a pre-test to make sure that you’re really one-hundred percent committed.

### Al Bundy on Women

“Don’t try to understand women, women understand women, and they hate each other” - Al
Bundy

### Lies and Lovers

Imposter procreation strategy: cuttlefish act like other females to prevent other males from
seeing them as competition. Act like you’re pro-life or e.g. act like you’re into hippy stuff.

### Women Love Drama.........................................................................................................

Some women need and love drama, and if there’s not drama in their life, they are going to
invent it.
You have a choice as a man. Do you want to fill your woman and give her what she
desperately needs by inventing risk-free drama that is contrived and actually not that big a deal,
or do you want them to experiment with bringing that drama? They’re not optimizing for risk-
freeness and you’re going to have problems. Either you can bring drama to the table or you can
let the woman bring it to the table. If you’re a smart guy and you know how to use your brain the
right way, you’re probably going to create a much better and higher class of problem than the
stuff that may be brought upon you.

### Stress-Testing Relationships

Women stress-test their relationships for excellence, the same way that government stress-test
banks and that factories stress-test backup generators. You need to see what things do when the
shit hits the fan, so that when it actually hits the fan, you’re safe. If you’re a woman, the stuff
hitting the fan for you is getting pregnant and not being able to work a job for nine months or
some period thereof, having to feed and take care of this child and work on reduced sleep, and
even endure pain and risk of injury. Giving birth isn’t easy, you might get injured in the deal.


How would you make sure that your support network, your backup generators that are your
loved ones, husband, family, would be there for you when the going gets rough?
Women have been conditioned to expect diamonds as an engagement accessory because they
hit you hardest in your wallet. Women want you make a serious commitment that took you
months to afford, it is how they weed out the false believers in a social system; with a transaction
cost, an entry fee. Funny how that evolved.
The worst way to discover your level of security would be to just dive right in and not do any
pre-testing and hope it all works out. A smarter way, a way that has evolved over time to result
in these weird behaviors from women that we don’t understand, is a sort of dependency test. Pre-
testing is used to measure the desire and ability for those that you interact with, your loved ones,
their ability to put up with terror and horror and stuff. The more easily, and with a smile on their
face, they deal with you at your worst, then the more safe and secure you should be in your belief
that when you need them the most, when you are your weakest that they will be there for you.
In order for a woman to know that she had the right guy who would be there for her when she
becomes pregnant, and during her weakest times, and needed someone else the most, an effective
character-testing strategy is forcing an argument where none needs to be had. One of the most
unique things about this understanding is that some women only appear to be happy once her
partner’s ego has been destroyed.
Once you have been in a rage to the point where you can’t breathe, once your day has been
ruined by whatever method they have chosen of either nagging about things you haven’t done,
telling you that some other guy was better, telling you that you’re a loser, that you don’t listen
and you don’t do things right and you’ll never be anything, or whatever strategy they happen to
pick to want to destroy you, her testing of your response is complete.
You think that there’s a way to strategize your way out of that, you think that if you behave
different they would stop doing that because you don’t realize why they’re doing it. They’re not
doing it to be true to some external standard of truth regarding whether you are sufficient as a
human being or not, they’re doing it to fill an unconscious drive to see you tortured and in pain,
and still stay and love them. That is what they subconsciously want to see that they can torture
you and you will still be there. There’s an art to allowing yourself to be tortured and love them
unconditionally, while having the value that you have other options, you are a prize and she is


lucky to have you. If she didn’t have you, someone would rapidly replace her and love to trade
spots with her. You need both.
She needs to know that she just barely has you, because you’re close to being out of her
league. You’re just in her league enough that she can act horrible and you’ll still be there for her,
and to find that line is really hard, because you don’t know what she thinks her league is. You
don’t know what she thinks are your best qualities, and those change over time. Sometimes they
want you to be dominant. Sometimes they want you to be loving and caring and sensitive. Good
luck accurately dispensing those vibes and methods of being, to end up with a higher and greater
experience of love and caring in a relationship and connection between a man and a woman. It is
not easy. And if it were easy, it probably wouldn’t be fun.
If you honor the intention of being terrible every once in a while as a stress test, then two
things will happen. One, you’ll be happier during a stress test because you know there’s a
potential positive benefit at the end; and two, if for some reason you didn’t have any stress
testing, you might want to invent some on your own that are fair and balanced if you care about
the volatility of relying on someone who’s not reliable, or thinking someone is there for you
when they’re really not. That type of person with those kinds of options looks at you and says,
“Oh! I could do better.” It’s like trying to date a girl who works at a restaurant or bar; they get hit
on two hundred million times a day. You come with your normal human being game and try to
game a professional who gets hit on all day long, and you realize that she doesn’t give a damn
about what you’re saying because she’s heard that same thing one hundred different times, so
you don’t get to use the strategy. To attract them you have to have some other thing, and those
other things are harder.

### What Do You Care About in a Woman?

What do you care about in a woman? Does she smell good? Will she be a good mom? Is she
fun sensually? Is she happy? Is she flexible, does she make you feel important? Is she honest?
Does she have good taste? Her taste is going to influence what your house looks like, her opinion
of you, what you wear and your choice of friends. Her friend’s problems are going to be your
problems. Her taste in a work environment, her problems at work are going to be your problems.
These are some of the things, maybe even most of the things that you care about in a lover
and a life partner. You could add to that list a lot of things that one could mention as important,


however, all it would do is reduce the number of people in the world that you could fall in love
with and have an amazing time with. Most people think that this concept of a soul mate exists,
that for some reason there’s just one other person out there for you and lucky you, they live near
you so you’ll find them. They speak the language you speak. They have similar beliefs.
However, it turns out that there are actually a lot of people that you can have a good relationship
with.

### The Time Value of Lovers

If it is true that all relationships come to an end (which in the longest case is by death), then it
is also true that relationships that are older have less time left in them. Therefore, the case can be
made that a relationship that is nearing the average death point (7 years declared, probably 5.5
years where the fun stops) does not have much time left in it. Then if a relationship has met a
certain threshold of length, say 4 months, then a 5-month-old relationship can be logically said to
be worth more for keeping well-functioning than a relationship that is 4.5 years old.
The 5-month relationship is statistically more likely to last a couple more good years than the
older relationship is. Sadly, our emotions aren’t programmed so strictly to optimize for happiness
years. There are also other social implications to whom you relate to, and when and how
relationships start and end, that are outside the optimization for gross total happiness days. The
counterintuitive discovery is that you are likely better off finding a new good relationship in
today’s environment than fixing a broken and aging one. This feels bad, however, it’s often what
works.
Should we be with different people? Is the sex just not as good as it should be because we’re
bored of it and that is normal? That happens. It’s very normal, it happens. People don’t want to
eat steak seven times a week. They can eat steak intermittently over a lifetime. Maybe you need
to rate limit how often you interact with the person, or maybe you need to switch people, or
maybe they change so much they can do better than you now. Maybe you change so much you
can do better than them now.

### Upgrading Your Partner


Better actually exists. You can actually upgrade your partner, it is actually a thing people are
programmed to say and pretend that they don’t think that can happen. It’s actually a program
falsehood, you want people to feel more secure than they should be and that you’ll never leave
them, because you think you’ll get more performance out of them if they don’t think you’ll ever
leave them. You’re scared that if they think you might leave them that they may see it as being
too risky.
Scivive believes that you can leave them no matter what, and then it was too risky to have
interacted with you in the first place. Scivivors believe in honesty, honesty feels great. Be honest
if someone is not up to your standards any more; tell them, “You are going to up your game or
we’re switching. That’s what’s up and let’s not pretend. If my game gets too bad, you’re going to
do the same thing. You just find a fancy excuse for it.”
Scivive would be willing to state that the financial and social penalties that exist for risky, low
reward, high potential damage things that exist in the criminal world should perhaps exist in the
social world. Maybe that’s why guys and girls react so violently when they discover their partner
was cheating. This might be because of the biological perspective. In the old days, there was no
genetic testing. If a woman had a kid and that kid wasn’t yours but you thought it was, now you
are permanently eliminated from the gene pool of the future of humanity unless you have another
kid with her that just happens to be yours. Or maybe you have another partner, or you donate
sperm to a sperm bank and someone actually uses it. Unless one of those three options becomes
true, you are permanently eliminated from the gene pool. Therefore, we have evolved and been
rewarded for being violently “pair bondish” and literally violently defensive of a pair bond
between two lovers, because perhaps those people that practiced polygamy just got opted out of
survival. They didn’t end up having enough kids of their own. After time passed, the people that
had a more effective strategy for promoting their genes into the future by having partners that
were monogamous with them are the ones who flourished.
Another strategy could be trying to be the guy that gets all the girls to cheat with you, I guess
you could do that too.

### Mate Status Signaling

#### Rings


Jimmy Fallon, who wears a wedding ring, fell down and nearly ripped off his finger. He said, “I
tripped and fell in my kitchen on a braided rug that my wife loves. My ring got caught on the
countertop when I was going down, and stuck there and pulled my finger off.” His injury was a
“ring avulsion” that required emergency micro-surgery in order to save his finger.
That’s the downside to wearing rings. The upside is fitness for mating signaling. You need to
choose. Keep a finger? Or keep a mate. There is a company that makes nice silicon rings that tear
before your finger does.

#### Hair Color

Can you think of a stupider way to decide which girls you like, or be influenced by, such as
hair color? The most commonly changed and inaccurate thing? Why choose to like things based
on the fakest thing possible?
Regarding hair color, if you believe that we have sex to create kids, and you believe that we
select certain traits that historically have created better kids—for instance, more caring women,
more muscular dudes, or smarter or funnier dudes—then if that’s what you’ve been selected for,
it’s why we see the changes that we do in areas of comedy, and areas of interests.

## Gay Behavior....................................................................................................................

If you say society chooses how a kid turns out, then why is it that young gay boys like what
girls like? Did society teach them that young gay kids were like that? No, because they don’t
have a reference for how young gay kids are supposed to act. It’s never been advertised to them.
Young gay boys do not act young and feminine because they were advertised that lifestyle. They
act that way because when your body is growing up, the difference between turning out
masculine and turning out feminine isn’t that big. Signaling exists to give you the only clues you
can have since you can’t scan DNA yourself.

## The Indiana Jones Dividend

Gambling and thrill and adventure are supposed to pay you positive returns. You’re supposed
to be able to find resources that other people wouldn’t find. You’re supposed to demonstrate
traits of durability and power, because you have so much extra resources to spend on leisure and


adventure, which potential partners recognize that and are signaled towards that instead of those
mates that weren’t so bad-ass that they didn’t have the extra resources. It’s probably the reason
girls have bigger breasts than they need, because they don’t need bigger breasts.

## The Grand Illusion

Aesthetic is so very important now, to the point where women spend literally hours a day
every day reapplying the lie that is the fake hair, fake make up, fake lotion, fake tan, fake
everything. Everything’s fake, because a competitive market exists, and everyone out there is
fake, so you need to be fake too in order to keep up. That could amount to 25 percent of the work
day lying to everybody, which is pretty funny when they complain about when guys lie to them.
Guys shouldn’t lie, but at least understand that women lie too to keep up appearances; there’s not
a lot of real honesty going on here.
Every night is not your prom night. “Oh look, lips that are too red. Breasts that are too big,
looking they stand on their own, they basically have their own legs, great.” Men fall for all of
that stuff, and Scivive would argue, they are happy doing so.
It’s not fair that half of the population of the planet spends 25 percent of their waking hours
doing something that’s destroyed when they go to sleep. Guys can be more beautiful too, we can,
and we’re just not willing to pay that price. It is not worth that much. If it took two hours in the
morning for a guy to look 20 percent better, most of them would rather pass. Men don’t feel the
need to look that much better to justify two hours of daily prep. Most men are comfortable with
fifteen minutes of grooming in order to keep their appearances sharp.
Beyond that, dude! You need a better friend circle, or you need to get a soul mate and stop
trying to hunt a new one. It’s called vanity overhead. What’s your vanity overhead? How much
time do you waste sending out signals that no one cares about? You’re not curing cancer. You’re
barely making kids, nobody knows what you’re doing with that stuff. You’re trying too hard to
look too good, far too good. Maybe you also spend far too much time on social media, but you’re
not making money on it. You’re not making any money on social media. Stop spending your
whole life on it. Read a book instead; preferably this book...again.
Sex is a great way to create variety and select for useful stuff. Sex seems to amplify the
diversity rate, which amplifies the chance that something good happens, which amplifies the rate


at which robustness occurs. It also amplifies the mistakes that we get from things that didn’t
work out, but it’s a small price to pay for not becoming extinct.

## How Fast Can You Adapt?

The rate at which you can adapt is super important. Studies have been done on how important
the rate you adapt is, and it’s super important. Changing is not enough. Changing fast is more
important. In a world full of fake hair, fake nails, fake eyebrows, fake eyelashes, Botox, fake
breasts, fake lips, and that’s before the science kicks in. Is this a useful way to choose a partner,
on how good they are at making a fake person out of themselves? How attractive is your fake
person that is not you? How attractive are all the traits that you don’t have that you pretend to
have? Is that good for the world, or is that destroying otherwise useful signaling mechanisms that
used to be valuable in telling who was more fit, who was less fit, for reproductive activity?
If you want to know why all this trivial knowledge isn’t actually trivial, it’s because every
single man and every single woman is very likely to run into this problem of not getting along
with each other for reasons they don’t really understand.

## Rock Stars Work Hard to Get the Girls

A lot of people that you know love to have sensuality with multiple partners. Guys in
particular, guys that want to have multiple girls as partners get pissed off when a musician or a
rich person gets a lot of attraction and a lot of sensuality without seeming to put in the same
work that they did. But you don’t realize that they actually put in more work for longer, at a
harder task, and only through that work attained what you tried to find another way.
Guys will try and seem like they have more money than they do. As a strategy, guys will try
and seem more interesting popular than they are, because it’s easier to pretend to be popular, rich
and interesting than it is to actually be popular or rich or interesting. This exists in the animal
kingdom too. There are animals that are actually venomous, and then there are other animals that
look almost identical to them that aren’t venomous. It’s funny because they both get the result of
being treated with the respect that venomous animals do.

## What Do You Value?........................................................................................................


This is something I’ve told my friends for years: people who are more willing to experiment
physically at risk for an emotional gain are more willing to be sensual with you for fun. They’re
more willing to risk STDs or the fact that you’re some kind of crazy psycho, but they might be
able to have a fun sexual time. How might you know who these people are? Well, is their hair
colored a funny color?
I don’t like that one very much, by the way, because I don’t get along so well with those types
of people. They detect that I don’t actually like the same stuff that they like. I do well with
people who respect power, money, goals, future, etc. Performance oriented people who usually
form their family history came from a performance oriented, professional, money-style family.
A girl who’s going to love me the most is going to be a girl who wants an excellent financial
future and the respect of the professional and perhaps political people of the world. For the most
part, artists would vomit if they heard any of those words, because that’s gross. “Is that all you
are, the stuff you have? Is that all you are, the people you control? That’s disgusting!” Scivive
understands completely that mindset.)
Yes, that does sound kind of disgusting when you frame it that way.
However, when you frame it in the way that the clothes that you’re wearing were created by
companies, and the house that you’re living in was created by companies, and the drugs that you
take to cure sickness were created by companies; you learn that companies actually have human
beings getting stuff done. You should probably quit demonizing them because without them,
there’d be some warlords stepping on your neck right now and you’d be doing whatever he says.
Thus, back to the ventures of women or men.
People with tattoos, or use drugs, or smoke, or do other risky painful things personally that
have pleasurable emotional results are more likely to have sex with you because they’ve set the
frame. “If she smokes, she pokes.” That’s funny. There are probably a lot of other sayings;
“Does a girl have a kid? Ok, how’d she get that kid? Having sex.” You know who’s more likely
to have sex? A girl with a kid, instead of a girl that has a chastity belt on, an allergy to
relationships or doesn’t like the gender that you are.
You’re going to find a lot of that. You will meet people that do not want to have sex with
anyone that is your gender. Sometimes it’s a girl, sometimes it’s a guy and it’s totally normal,
you probably feel the same way. If you don’t feel that way, if you’re bisexual, multi sexual, poly
sexual, whatever fancy word you use for being more open with your sexuality. Do you have sex


with machines? Do you sleep with people with learning disabilities? I can keep moving this bar
to some point where you find you that yes indeed, there is something you don’t want to have sex
with, and therefore you shouldn’t be so hard on the rest of the world that just happens to not want
to have sex with you.
You’re going to save yourself a lot of hatred, animosity and you’re going to stop punishing
yourself for something that is actually healthy for the world and something that you’re doing and
profiting from personally. Anytime you get rejected by somebody and you want to take it
personally, because it’s probably the most personal thing that there could be, realize that you
would be doing the exact same rejection to millions of other people in the world if the
opportunity presented itself. It’s going to take the edge off.

## Sales Vs Marketing in Love

There’s people who have taken the other path, where they go for developing themselves; and
as a result, they get better quality women. They also put less time into doing it, because they
worked on their product development instead of sales.
Love your fellow man and woman. They’re the best things you will ever find in this world,
and the best thing you will ever be.
Be loved, go where you find the people beautiful, or where they find you beautiful.
One-night stands are like trying to fill the ocean with sand. Shovel as much as you like, the
sea will never fill.

## Male-Female Relationships

If you designed male-female human relationships from scratch, you would make sure that the
best looking guys got the best looking girls, and the worst looking people get the other worst
looking people, more or less. It’s pretty stupid to try and achieve performance out there in the
rest of the world, when there’s so much to be done at home, when you could work yourself to the
top of your game, and then you could get what you deserve.

## Women Want Diamonds


Women want diamonds because they drain your wallet. The same reason when they’re on
their period they want you to suffer. It is how you weed out the false believers in a social system.
With a transaction cost, an entry fee. Funny how that evolved. Pre-nup, are you million dollars
funny?

## Humor

If you ever want to impress a girl, pretend you’re a cat holding down its milk bowl with its V-
shaped paw and trying to lick up all the milk.

## Be Loved

If you truly want to be loved, you’ve got two options. Search harder, to find someone that
loves you as you are. Or, improve who you are. Be more loveable.

## Pickup: Great Game Means More Flakes

Having great game means you’ll experience more flakes. If they don’t flake, you will. When
your game is really tight, you’re going to end up sleeping with lots of people you wouldn’t
normally get along with. This means less second dates, because when the magic wears off, you’ll
get a lot more flakiness. You’ll be flaky too; everything was wonderful and you were super
interested, now you really don’t care much. Or, you’ve learned to really not care much, because
the glue that would normally cause continued interaction, either the workplace, or really similar
outlooks on life or habits, probably isn’t there. What was there was beauty, and in a world of not
too many good leads, beauty is usually enough.

## Some Loves Are Better than Others

Some loves are better than others. When a crazy person loves you, they might think that
killing your dog is doing you a favor so you don’t have to watch them die slowly one day of old
age.
It’s the same from your perspective as well, the amount of love you show someone is
probably more variable than you know, based on how you think they’re treating you perhaps.


Thus, when people use suitcase words such as love, it kind of leaves out the measuring of the
strength, the quality; not all cheeseburgers are the same either.

## Managing Expectations

People come up to me because I dress in an interesting way and I’m with beautiful people, but
I wouldn’t be probably considered to be so beautiful myself. I could lose ten kilos. Anyway,
when people approach, you’re always curious of what their motive is. Do you just want to meet
people who dress nice or are you curious, like is it the best outcome for you to satisfy your
curiosity of what is this interesting thing I’ve ever seen before? Are you looking for funding and
you think that I have money? Everyone’s got an angle.
I was teaching this idea of switching your “buts” to “ands,” and you’re going to get much
more compliance, you’re going to be much more friendly, you’re going to make the same points
and say the same stuff, so if you’re going to make the same points except have more impact and
make more friends, you should definitely do that and that’s what switching “buts” to “ands” and
honoring intention does.
That whole thing was like basically about how you should use trainer tricks. You should use
positively framed language to garner attention, look cool and hang out with cool people, and then
out-going social people will say hello and meet you.

## If You’re a Minimalist, You’ll Be Happy Changing Your Attitude

If you are minimalist about what you really care about in a lover, friend, an employee, or even
yourself, then you’re going to find a lot more happiness in life because you’re going to greatly
increase the available parties you can interact with. That brings you more joy and happiness.
If you think that no one deserves to be your friend unless they are heads of state and in charge
of a country, you’re kind of screwed because it’s very hard to hang out with those people. They
change every four years depending on what country you live. They have reasons to not be
truthful and their friendship towards you does to trade disputes or keeping the people that vote
for them happy.
Wouldn’t you be much better served by not requiring your friends to be heads of state, or
have IQs over two hundred, or be world champions of some sort? The more restrictive you are


about the requirements that you have to feel happiness with a person in your life, the harder it
will be for you to have that. Consequently, as a side effect, not only will it be harder to attain, but
it will also be harder to keep.
You see the same thing with people. The more artificially restrictive you are with what
requirements must be met in order for you to find happiness in a partner, the less happiness will
you have. By the way, this applies with employee that you might want, or a company that you do
business with, or yourself. If you have a rule that you can only be happy with yourself when you
have had snow on zero days for hundred days in a row, and achieve a body fat index of 15
percent, and you’re the strongest you’ve ever been—you’re going to have a rough time.
The more you compound that, the harder you make it. It’s like adding extra locks to a door.
Now the door to happiness for you has twenty locks on it instead of one. Which is more likely
for you to get into your house in a reasonable time frame, the door with twenty locks of twenty
different keys, or the door with one lock and one key? How do you know how often you need to
go in that door? How much overhead are you willing to have in your life to meet the standard
that you and only you is responsible for in the end?
It is perhaps more accurate that lots of people are responsible for it, but you have the most
influence over it. We might as well say “you and only you,” but in reality we mean that even if
you happened to inherit or adopt some bad beliefs in regards to what must happen in order for
you to be happy, you have the power to change, as well as the power to believe it’s totally fair to
feel good if any given level gets set right.
Scivive has talked about how this pertains to relationships and how there’s a side effect of you
being overly picky; not only will you never attain your dream partner, and even if you did
temporarily, you won’t be able to keep the relationship because the other person has so many
options. They’re harder to get, they’re harder to keep. As you lower the requirements for what
you need to be happy, not only does it become easier to get what you want, but they’re going to
make you happier.
Very closely related to this, by the way, is not only can you choose a standard by which you
hold the other people in your life to, but also the standards you hold yourself to. You can also
change the rate at which you measure whether people are meeting those standards. That rate
becomes the frequency at which you determine your happiness level based on your standards and


expectations of to others. Scivive hopes you have a frequency; you have to do things at least
twice to have a frequency.

## The Life Cycle of a Relationship

Things normally deteriorate over time. You might have started with a good relationship. Your
relationship now might be a piece of crap, but you just never noticed because you’re busy at
work or doing something else. By the way, if you didn’t notice that your relationship turned to
crap, you’re a bad partner, because it means you’re not focusing on the things that are important
to a relationship. If you’re not bringing joy, happiness, importance and security to your partner
and that’s not on the list of things that you’re focused on, and that’s the reason that you didn’t
notice those things weren’t happening for them or for you, you’re a bad partner. You play catch
even though you’re not really playing catch. You’re just playing catch with yourself, that’s not
the highest and best relationship to have. Maybe make it a ritual; “How’s my relationship doing?
Are there some things I should be doing better?”

## Friends: Negative Peer Group

Don’t train negative, and don’t game imbeciles and shmucks. If you’re coming up with a list
of crap to tell people you meet because the truth is too scary for them, find a better group of
people. Really try to find that more empowering group instead of training to be less than your
best self.
When you’re doing better than someone else, and you let them discover it to some degree,
they will hate you. Only the very rare and most advanced people can actually find joy in
someone else’s superiority to them, in a trait they have that they’re proud of.

## Stress Testing

Won the lottery? Before you let anyone you know you won, ask all your friends to borrow
some money and help you move. Unfriend the ones who refuse.
If you’ve got real balls, never let anyone know.

## Friends and Money


Does everyone have a good trait? Most people do. If you’re creative, intelligent and sincere,
you can find it and give them a truly beautiful compliment. You actually have to know them
thoroughly first.
As you advance in this world, you realize that one of the quickest ways to get rid of a friend
is to lend one more money than one can repay. What option does he or she have? To do
something that’s very hard; get rid of free time, try and find some type of gainful employment
that is comfortable to pay you back, or to imagine that you’re actually not such a nice guy;
you’re actually a jerk and you don’t deserve to get paid back. Which of those two things is
easier? Now you’ve lost the money and the friend. If you want to keep your friends, you can give
them money. By the way, they hate that too. They grow animosity for that as well, because
you’re stealing their dignity from them. Everyone wants to have pride in themselves, everyone
wants to be self-sustaining, nobody wants to be a leech of a sycophant, and for you to pay for
people’s things, subconsciously harms them. It literally harms them. Very few people, can
genuinely appreciate a gift and not, to some degree, feel like they have to retaliate.

## Employees Are Worth More Than Friends

If you’re in a house, it’s unlikely that it was built by friends of any sort. It’s likely that it was
built by employees, because employees do what you tell them to do in exchange for you giving
them a lot of value in return; value that you had to earn previously as well. That exchange of
value for value, or money for labor. If you pay someone to paint something and then in return
you paint for someone else, then it’s like a proxy.
The reason employees always work out so well is because functionally, it’s the same as you
doing it yourself, so by that token employees are more important than friends. There are some
more examples as to why that’s the case. How many friends do you have that are actually good
friends? Six? Eight? It depends, if you can build some relationships without communicating very
much, but still maintain friend status. It’s probably not more than twenty. On the other hand, as
far as employees go, you can have a lot more than 20 and you shouldn’t limit yourself to
progress that only 20 people could provide for you when you could have hundreds or thousands.
Wouldn’t you be surprised if there were companies out there that had hundreds of thousands?
Maybe Walmart does.


## Scaling with Other People.................................................................................................

Don’t spend time on learning or talking to single individuals when you can create a
framework that can allow other people to do it. Write a spec, enforce it by means of an enforcer;
then you’re no longer limited by your hours. You’re now only limited by your money and other
people’s hours. Your ability to choose the right people and enforce that they are actually getting
the things done is critical. Don’t teach, don’t absorb more info, you have done enough of that.
Scale through other people’s hours. That way when balls are dropped, you aren’t left there
feeling like stuff.
Let’s take a look at Bill Gates, who was once the richest person in the world. Even if he
doesn’t regain that status he’s still in the top one percent of anyone that’s ever existed in the
history of mankind. And if you took his wealth and compared it to the ten people close to him
they would have a much higher combined wealth. Because no matter how rich you are, ten
people combined that are in your peer group will be richer. Well that’s interesting. So, wouldn’t
it be smarter to convince these ten people that have more than you will ever have, no matter how
hard you could ever possibly work or how much luck you ever got, wouldn’t it be smarter to let
those ideas that so influenced you and invigorated you influence those groups that are far greater
that you could ever be? Yes! And that’s why he does it. That’s why Bill Gates doesn’t just do his
own thing, Bill Gates has the giving pledge, which attracts other billionaires and multi-
millionaires to give huge portions of their wealth away, sooner rather than later, to things that
they believe in.
A lot of smart people think that the solutions to the problems that they have are themselves.
They think if they take the right nootropics, if they work harder, if they put more hours in, that’s
going to get them to where they want to be. Truth of the matter is, you yourself don’t scale; you
can’t do ten times as much work. If you could do ten times as much work, you could only do it
once. But when you use other people, when you use the power of the Internet, when you use the
power of machines, when you have machines and other human beings helping you do things, you
don’t just get a single 10x benefit. You can get it over and over and over again, because the rest
of the world scales, you don’t. All those things that you do, trying to drug yourself and do uber-
man method sleep experiments, when they mess up, you have down time. Find the machines,
people, and systems that can scale in ways that you can’t and do things that you can’t.


That’s the same type of holistic thinking that leads you away from trying to extract
performance out of yourself and towards extracting performance out of other people. How do
you become less important to the organization because you’ve done such a good job hiring? How
do you become less important to your unhappiness, because you’ve surrounded yourself with the
right systems and habits and people? The joy is nearly effortless. No hard busting of ass on your
own.

## The Art of Taking Advice from Losers

Do losers have good ideas? Yes, they can. Can you learn from losers? Yes, you can. The trick
is to know whether this loser is offering you good advice through actual experience, or offering
you the advice that is untested. That’s the magic. Stopped clocks are right twice a day and losers
are often right too. The magic is checking to see if the loser’s advice is given intelligently
elsewhere. A quorum is a fancy word for getting a few different opinions on a thing and seeing if
there’s a consensus.
It seems like the best books on success are never written by the most successful people, the
best books on relationships are never written by the people with the best relationships, and the
best books on happiness are never written by the happiest people. It also seems that the best
sports coaches are never the best players. For that reason, be willing to give some leeway.

## Family: Child Support and Alimony

Kids don’t forcefully receive any more money after the age of 18, but if you get a divorce,
your ex gets paid forever. Not the same 18 years that kids get, but forever. Why is this?

## Loaning to Your Family....................................................................................................

This is one of those situations where, in a world where everyone’s playing a slightly different
video game, the intuitive solutions that you have are sometimes are the worst things you can do.
“Oh, my family member needs money. Let me lend it to them. He’ll pay me back. Oh, I’ve never
heard from my family member again, and now they tell anyone that’ll listen that I’m a piece of
stuff because they owe me money.” Oops. Scivivors didn’t get that memo; that that’s actually
perhaps the wrong way to handle giving money to family.


Give it to them? Or get a collateral upfront, or don’t give it to them? Or, give it to them and
make sure they pay it back? But if you’re giving and they can’t pay it back, you probably just
lost a good relationship. You paid for the privilege of making them a worse person. They don’t
teach you these ideas in most schools and it’s really important to learn. You could call that
wisdom. Why don’t they have a class called wisdom? It would be doable. Maybe this great work
of advice is that class.

## Children: Birth Control, and Choosing Comfort Over the Future of Humanity

Because contraceptives are effective, eventually the world will have selected through
evolution for people that actually want to have kids as opposed people that inadvertently have
kids through having sex. Contraceptive effectiveness makes not creating kids easier, whereas
people who want to have kids actually have them. In a few hundred years from now, you’re
going to see a lot of those people that wanted to have kids—or we’re just bad at using
contraceptives.
If your biology affects your society, and over time, your society actually affects your biology,
it’s a never-ending cycle. Guys today keep opting for big boobs. That keeps happening. People
are going to bigger boobs, because heredity exists; that’s the selection pressure. We had biology
that affected our society, and now our society affects our biology. If you need to take care of
your child for years so he or she can survive on their own, then you can do more programming
through nurture and less programming through nature because you have the time to do so.
It’s easy to discount all of the things that lead to children as things that you don’t care about
and are not focused on. It’s also important to understand that the reason you get to play in this
game is because it’s very likely that your parents had sex, probably more than once, and were
either bad at using condoms or were told that mommy couldn’t get pregnant or they actually
wanted to have a kid. One could imagine it is not the most common outcome, and that maybe
most guys that have sex do it for the joy, while preferring that kids not come out of it.

## Make Something That Lasts..............................................................................................

What we have now is a disagreement, a misalignment of desires between the system that
allowed us to exist and the future. If 10,000 years from now we compared what was left over


from you assuming you were not still around (which is a pretty good bet, no one has lived that
long yet so it’s unlikely that you will be the first) then what’s more likely to be around, your
genes in the form of your offspring, or a building that you built? It just so happens that buildings
crumble, and we don’t have any 10,000-year-old buildings around here. Out of all the things in
this world that you can literally build with your own hands, energy, and time, a child is the most
likely thing that will take parts of you and take it into the future.

## Choosing Self Over (Future) Others

Your offspring will look like you and operate like you, if you were there to raise them, and
even if you were not. Nature matters, as does nurture, but if you didn’t have the nurture the
nature would still matter. So now we live our lives trying to optimize for ourselves greedily at
the cost at the future, and some people could be okay with that trade. Maybe you are almost okay
with the next 10,000 years having a little more hardship if there’s a chance that you can have a
better life now. Is it greedy? Yes, by definition it is, for the same reason you don’t let a bunch of
strangers in your house and you don’t let them into your wallet. In this world of limited
resources, that which preceded you has engrained in you the value of choosing self over others,
family over others, kin over others, friends and team mates over others. Any one of you that
decides that you are going to try and shift that paradigm and do a different thing, you will be
selected against and you will be removed from competition. You will not have offspring and
your offspring may not survive because you tried to be smarter than the system that brought you
into this world.
What’s right for the future of the world is often wrong for us individually, and what’s wrong
for the future is right for us from a short term or mid-term personal development standpoint.
Do you care about money? Do you care about excellence in areas that are not producing kids?
If you do, producing kids is going eat up a lot of your time, and while it will give you fulfillment
that you couldn’t otherwise get, and in the mid- to long term it’s going to pay off great,
(hopefully), it is still a trade.


## Stupid Classifications

There appears to be many advertisements for diversity and quotas and report cards out there.
Why are you classifying by race? Why don’t you classify by stupid? How many stupid people
have you hired? Or how many rage-filled people? Or how many depressed people? Or how many
people who always say the wrong thing? Why are you using race to select between people?
Doesn’t that make you a racist? Isn’t there some more important categorization that you can use
for humans? You’re better off dividing people by profession, or by their free time activities.
Some people act one way at work and act another way when they’re not at work.
Driving tests. Do you think that everyone, when they reach sixteen years of age, should get a
driver’s license? Obviously not, and that’s why we have tests. Do you think that only people that
have reached the age of sixteen in the United States should be the only people that are allowed to
take those tests? It’s probably true that some people aren’t ready at twenty, and some people are
ready at twelve, because we don’t all develop at the same rate. We have diversity. We have the
excellence, robustness and the redundancy of multiple people with multiple growth strategies.
Some people are early bloomers, and some people are late bloomers. Some people are good with
hand/eye coordination and driving, some people are idiot savants who can’t ever drive anything,
but if you ask them when the second Tuesday of March was a couple thousand years ago, they
know the date. Or vice versa, you tell them the date, they tell you which day of the week it was.
There are people that have mental ability and mental capacity in great excess, in a certain area,
because they have diminished capacity in another area.

## Intellect Distribution


Now, is that to say that it’s a zero-sum game? Is that to say that you can only have intellect in
an area if you become stupid someplace else? No, definitely not. Because of the power of
analogy, the more you understand about the world in one area, the more you understand about
the world in all the other areas, as long as you learn how to apply the analogy and framework
somewhere else. It may not increase what they call in the study of intelligence, your “Big G,”
your general intelligence, how well you do on an IQ test, but you can have a high “Big G”
without ever learning a language. You can have Big G in intelligence without ever learning how
to do anything. If you were deprived of basically all enriching information, born on an island and
didn’t have culture or have never heard a joke, or never heard a song, you would still have the
Big G that you were born with. Let’s see Big G for what it is: it’s a useful metric to decide
whether there are some exercises that have good fall-over usefulness.

## Giving / Reciprocity

Very few people can genuinely appreciate a gift and not, to some degree, feel like they have
to reciprocate. A properly programmed person is going to reciprocate with another awesome gift,
and you’ve got a self-referencing thought; i.e., “Christmas time, I love giving gifts, they love
giving gifts, everyone’s happy, and it’s win for everybody.” That’s what gift giving is. It’s
convincing you to do something for yourself, but the thing that you’re doing for yourself is that
you’re doing it for someone else. “I’m too lazy to scratch my back, but I’ll scratch yours, and
then you’ll scratch mine because we believe in reciprocity. The end result is you’ve got a
scratched back and I’ve got a scratched back, but neither one of us would have scratched our
own out of laziness.”
The reason that gift giving exists in the world, and the reason that credit is so powerful in the
world, is because it’s the lubrication that causes human beings to get motivated and do things
that their otherwise lazy, calorie-saving brain wouldn’t engage in.
We need those heroes to go out there and run three-minute miles, or whatever that crazy
number is for the super-low time in which one can run a mile. Scivive can assure you, most
people never come close to running such a thing. But we need those people who can excel and
like to give gifts. We need those people who like to make other people happy. We need those
people who are willing to take it on faith and give you credit, that they’ll do a thing for you


today, or give you a thing today, because in the future they believe that you’ll pull through and
do the right thing afterward.
Without those amplifiers, without those lubricants, things would grind to a halt and no one
would do anything for anyone. It’s a tragedy that you see during times of depression that giant
masses of intelligent, useful people with access to resources are not able to overcome the resting
friction of laziness, or the difficulty of asset allocation. They’re too greedy and they don’t want
to part with the thing until it’s paid for, because they’re afraid they’ll never get paid. Then if
enough people do that, nobody does anything anymore. Houses don’t get built, mortgages cannot
be offered, and people start sleeping in tents.
It’s funny that when you ask people for respect and gratitude, they get first-level benefit from
being grateful, then they get the happiness. You get to watch the happiness, you’re one level
removed. They got paid to generate it, and you had to pay to generate it. You had a cost and they
had a benefit. It’s hilarious, it’s something that costs them nothing so they literally profit from
the impetus. Something that benefits them directly, whereas you just get to watch them
benefiting and derive some indirect benefit which has to be begged for; or has to be fought for.
How did that evolve? How did those who are turning down the profit twice to direct any actual
impetus cost evolve?

## Thresholds / Testing

That concept of tipping points and thresholds is interesting, like the sayings, “Guests are like
fish, they begin to stink after three days,” or “Wind to a relationship is like wind to a flame, is
like distance to a relationship: a small amount makes it stronger, and too much extinguishes it.”
This whole concept of thresholds existing is very interesting. There’s a saying that you shouldn’t
test friends because they’ll fail. Don’t unfairly test friends, or test them for no good, wholesome
reason. If you can reasonably fairly test people for something that’s important, without much
overhead cost or without appearing to be manipulating, then it can be useful. One could probably
write an entire separate book on how to prune your social garden to have more enjoyment and
less pain from the friends, lovers, and family relationships that you have at your life; that’s a
book on its own.
Should you test those around you? Yes. Not in a time consuming manner, and not
unreasonably. Is it reasonable for someone to test the fire department by burning their house


down? No. Is it reasonable for people to test their immune system by injecting weird diseases
into their blood? No. Is it reasonable to test your blood clotting by chopping your head off? No.
The amount that you can gain by testing someone is actually in direct proportion to the options
you have upon a failed test. If you like to test all the girls that you’re with, what are the only
possible outcomes resulting from that test? They could pass or they could fail. Or, they could get
an inconclusive or detect it. You’re a testing a person, and most people don’t like that stuff
because of all risk for them. If they pass, they’re still where they started, but if they fail, their life
is much worse. It’s like it’s an option that’s one directional for them. When you test people,
they’re mostly getting bent over on the deal. You’re actually to some small degree harming
everyone that you test because you’re offering them the opportunity of getting kicked out of your
life with the upside of basically nothing.
You don’t even want to tell them that it was a test because then they’ll punish you for doing
that test. It’s an interesting metric to know that you harm those people that you test to some
degree. In the corporate environment, when you give people tests that are time consuming, you
used up the time of lots of people for a test. There’s a requisite to a job, but you’re only giving
one person the job. That’s like having an artistic project, a competition to draw a logo for you
and lots of people compete, but only one of the logos gets chosen. Think about how many man
hours of, somewhat (but not totally) wasted time occurred because they were all doing the same
work, when, perhaps you could have looked at the field of participants to see if any of their other
work was good enough and only picked the ones that had a chance of winning?
Therefore, the concept is that testing is actually an attack on the other person. This could be a
very interesting discovery. When you’re out there harming your loved ones and the people on
your team by testing them, you better have some upside for doing that. The upside that you have
only exists if upon a failure by them you can do something better.
For a thought experiment, let’s assume you live on a deserted island with one other person
and you’re lovers, if you test them and they fail, you may come to dislike them. Now they’re not
worthy of your time. Your only option at that point is loneliness, because you’re on a deserted
island.
If only one person in the world can perform a job, for some weird reason, then there’s no
reason to test them! They do the job or they don’t; if you test them and they fail, you are still
going to hire them because you hope that that was just a random mistake from that only guy


suitable for the job. How much do you want the job actually to get done? Maybe you want to
save your money so much that you just don’t ever hire them. Maybe in that case, the testing still
matters. The point is, testing only becomes valuable with an increased amount of changes that
you can make upon a failure. If you can’t afford to go back out there and find a new party to
interact with, or you can’t afford to hire somebody that’s better, maybe you’re better off
lowering your standards than testing and failing somebody out of the pool when you don’t have
any options. Now, should you have more options? Yes. Go build them, become worthy of them.
Should you deserve an amazing relationship? Yes. Be an amazing partner. Earn the right to
demand an amazing relationship, whether in business or in love.
The discovery that Scivive is trying to share with you is testing can be good. It can be bad, it
can be harmful. It usually is, and its value has more to do with you and the options you have
based on when that other party that’s been tested fails. It has less to do with the party that’s
tested—you’re not bringing much value to their life by giving them that lose-or-break-even
experience. Unreasonable, unfair tests for particularly greedy and jealous self-serving motives
that don’t help the other party should be considered punishable and as a tax.

### Signals

Much of what makes you human primarily developed for others to observe rather than for you
to experience. It was more for them, and through their correct response and your bond to them,
than it was for you. Laughter, yelling when surprised, crying—all are signaling mechanisms built
to tell those around you the truth faster and more honestly than you could consciously through
speaking effort. This is why dogs raise their tails and wag them; they need a fast thought-free
method to communicate important information to their pack. What real advantages do we have
as humans over all the other animals in the kingdom? Intelligence, communication, and tools.
How good would the tools be without communication? Without someone being able to tell you
or show you by example how to make or use one, you wouldn’t get too far.
Crying is a signaling mechanism that you genuinely need assistance. When someone scares
you and you scream, that’s intended for everyone else to come help your ass! Posture, eye
contact, crying, yelling, body movement, all of these things, they are signaling.

### Feeling Important


There are a lot of people on this green planet, and we all want to feel important. You want to
feel important, everyone wants to feel important. Why? Because it’s the social world we live in.
You most likely don’t make your own food, or didn’t invent this language that you are reading
in. You don’t make your own clothes, you didn’t pave the roads, and you didn’t refine the gas
that’s going in the car. You need other people to survive, and if other people don’t think you’re
important, if you’re not significant, and if civilization starts to deteriorate or resources become
very limited, you would get left out first and nobody wants that for themselves. We’re
programmed to be meaningful among society.
Another upside: if there is wisdom of the crowds, which by theory in study there is, how do
you execute the wisdom of the crowds personally? You need to care about the crowd, and what
does that mean? It means that you’re not a psychopath without feeling and empathy and caring
about what other people think. This means that if you care about what other people think, then
you must want to be respected by them. You want them to think you’re important and look at the
social group you’re in and feel important and have significance.
Now, do some people do this wrong? Yes. Some people try and get significance in a way that
is more harmful than meaningful. Some people receive significance or respect at the end of a
gun, some people get it through gang membership, and some people get it through self-harm or
by harming others.
The Jackass (television show) guys became very successful and caused a lot of laughter in the
world by destroying their bodies. These guys bodies are nearly destroyed; they have catheters,
they are missing tons of teeth, they have PTSD, they have huge health issues because they
sacrificed their bodies for probably lots of reasons, but one important one was the significance
and feelings of the people who saw them doing what they were doing. They didn’t just mess their
bodies up, they messed their bodies up with lots of cameras and those lots of cameras were an
important part of what they did. If they were alone, you’d find they did a lot less of that crazy
self-harming stuff. For social situations that are in front of the camera, they’ll engage in riskier
behavior because the profit to them is more. If you’re the only one laughing, it’s funny, but if
you and the rest of the world is laughing, it’s way funnier!
What’s the summary of this section? There are more and less profitable ways to become
significant. Some of the things you might do to become significant, like flapping your lips and
talking when you already know the person you’re talking to understands what you’re trying to


say, but you just want to seem smart so you keep talking. If communication is as useful as
getting an idea from one person to another, we’ll say that’s the level one form of communication,
maybe influence and motivation will be level two, and level three. Let’s say level one is just
getting the idea across. As soon as you know you got your idea across, please shut up and let the
next good idea spread.
Men say women are a mystery and very hard to understand. It turns out that they’re only hard
to understand and a mystery if you don’t understand the evolutionary psychology and game
theory behind what they do. When you start to analyze that and have it in your head rather
quickly, or the tacit understanding of it, then you understand why they do what they do, and you
understand why it works and how you might not even suggest that they change much of it.
Apparently everyone wins imaginary arguments in their showers. Due to the prevalence of the
confession, it’s obvious how important relationships and significance are in our society. Studies
show that the pain you feel when you don’t get the attention you desire from a person you feel is
important, is nearly the same pain you feel from physical pain.
How do you feel important? Maybe through force. But how do you get away with it? Have a
good excuse. There are guys who go out, dying for an excuse. Sometimes life’s got you down,
and you don’t feel like you’ve got a way out. You want to hurt somebody, because it works. You
hurt somebody, and now you feel important and they will show you respect. Now you have more
power because you just took it. It’s not beautiful. It’s weird though, that it may make you feel
good at least temporarily. We all have that piece of stuff in us that wants to do the wrong thing
sometimes.
When you’re not feeling good, and someone screws up royally, you may wish to social justice
warrior that guy, which is the popular thing. People get their violence out through social justice
warrior tactics lately.
Social justice warriors want to do negative reinforcing, retaliatory actions under the guise of
something positive. It’s just a way to feel more important, more significant and be violent and
hurtful towards someone else with a good excuse. You can be compassionate to people who are
bigots, that’s not social justice warrior. It’s not called social justice, it’s called social justice
warrior.

### We Survive Through Cooperation.....................................................................................


For child bearing to take so long, and for survival in general against other tribes, against the
elements, animals and disease, and just general life is so hard, we needed to develop that
strength, we needed to develop that cooperation, or we would just be lizard or tiger food. To not
be something’s food is actually a lot of work. That animal wants to kill you and eat you, and you
have the littlest teeth and claws of all, so what do you have? You possess cooperation and tools,
with cooperation being the most important; for if someone didn’t teach you how to build the tool,
it is very unlikely that you would figure it out on your own. You don’t even get to use tools
without cooperation. You think that if you were on an island you would know to make a spear?
Even knowing that spears exist and how they are made, you still might not figure it out. You
might never make a good spear, and if you can’t make a good spear, what can you make? That’s
the most basic tool in the world. You need to cut wood, you need a knife, but how do you make a
rope? No idea, twist some stuff together, see if that works.
It gets a lot trickier with emotional needs, there needs to be an emotional service industry,
“more on demand.” We have physical services on demand, such as ordering a pizza. People
schedule dates with their therapists all day long. Anybody that sits and listens to your damn
problems, even if they just nod, you feel that that person is important, and connected, vital and
really helping you. That’s what you probably feel and it’s probably true. Human beings need to
feel heard.
What could give more significance than shutting up and listening to someone else? Actually
listening to them. How could you give someone more significance than that? When you had an
idea today, how much time did someone put into making sure they understood it? All the time it
took! Because they know it’s important for you to feel that understood. It’s very important. It’s
also greedy for the listener, one may want to understand what you are saying. Might turn out
beneficial for them, because you might be saying something really useful.

### Success Leaves Clues

You’ve heard the saying, “success leaves clues,” which has been made popular by Tony
Robbins and Jim Rohn, two extremely successful performance coaches. You hear it so often and
it’s so obviously true that no one ever does anything with it. People hear that science works, and
then you notice that they don’t do any science themselves. You hear people talk about how
important it is to eat healthy and then you look at what they eat and you’re thinking, “Wow. It’s


like these people discovering that a good thing exists allows them to feel like they’re profiting
vicariously by other people actually doing the things while they, themselves, do the opposite.”

### The Illusion of Vicarious Satisfaction

You could almost make the statement that telling people that there’s a better way to do things
and showing people that they are doing them better could actually do those people harm, in that
they might think that those people are part of their social group and therefore enough of that is
being done already, that they actually feel benefit from it by proxy. For instance, there’s a girl
you want to make love to, but you already have a girlfriend, so you want to have your friend
hook up with that girl because some part of you feels great profit in seeing that girl get hooked
up with by someone else in your crew, in your group, in your family. That doesn’t just exist in
interpersonal relationships with group fitness, it also exists in stuff that you choose not to do
because you subconsciously think someone else on your crew is already doing it, but in reality
this isn’t the type of thing where there’s a herd immunity.
There is no herd immunity for being a fat, overweight individual. The health costs of you
being an overweight person will arrive upon you, regardless of how many of your friends choose
to be overweight as well. Now, you could abstract and make some fancy excuse that their gut
biomes are different, they might share saliva with you, they might be more resistant to disease
and have better immune systems and somehow that would benefit you, but let’s be serious, you
would get those same benefits more or less if you weren’t fat yourself.
Anyway, the discovery here is that sometimes people feel as though they’re making progress
by watching other people’s progress, like watching sports. Your team is winning, you feel like a
winner, but let’s be serious, your team is not actually your team. It’s a group of people who
wouldn’t give you the time of day if they saw you. You think and you brainwash yourself into
thinking your team, your tribe and your club and you are all kicking ass together because your
team is kicking ass, but in reality you _’_ re not kicking ass, they are.
In reality, in a time of war, they’re not kicking ass either, they’re playing a game when there’s
real stuff at stake. The playing of games and the optimizing of outcomes for people who aren’t
you, but you have somehow decided are a part of you; the teams you choose, the friends you
choose, the family that you probably didn’t get to choose, but continue to allow to be a part of
your life, don’t mistake their progress and their excellence for your own. Don’t starve yourself


from excellence and progress because you’ve already fulfilled that desire and become full on the
food of other people’s progress.

### The Four Human Needs, Not Six

Tony Robbins says that all pain comes from one of your six needs not being met, but Scivive
has some problems with that formulation. Tony Robbins’s six human needs are a useful way to
look at the very complex inputs and outputs of the human emotional system. However, at the
same time, they are inaccurate and wishful, and even though they are inaccurate and wishful,
they are still way more useful than most other related ideas.
Tony Robbins’s six human needs are: certainty, significance, variety, connection, growth, and
contribution. Growth and contribution do not exist as needs for lots of people, because many
people are happy with the way things are. They don’t need anything else, they’re happy.

### How to Apologize Properly

People want to be apologized to, because it reduces the chance that they’ll need to be
apologized to again. If someone harms you or wrongs you, what is most important to you is that
they don’t do it again. Apologies are a way to gain confidence as to the brightness and excellence
of your future by having a life free from unnecessary or unfair harm. The person who has harmed
you understands the following things: they understand exactly what harm was done, why that
harm was unfair, how the harm occurred, and why the harm shouldn’t occur. They tell you how
they’re not going to harm you in the future, and they tell you why it’s important to themselves
that they not harm you in the future, and how they’re going to specifically not harm you in the
future. The combination of original understanding of what occurred, intention as to why what
occurred was bad, intention and understanding as to how the occurrence happened, then leads
you into correct future action for correct future good reason.
The issuance of all of those things must be with sincerity, because sincerity is required to
have a confidence that the plan gets executed. Just because someone knows they did you wrong
and don’t want to do you wrong again, they may do it again anyway because there’s so much
profit in it, or it’s their habit, or it’s their nature. When someone apologizes on one or more
occasions, their apology can be worthless if it is insincere.


The point is to give you, as a reasonable person, a better feeling about being apologized to so
that you can operate cooperatively with them again, or realize that they’re deceptive and that you
need to move on with your life and not give them the chance to make the same mistake twice,
because you don’t believe in the likelihood that they’ll follow through and not harm you again.
That’s the reason sincerity is so important, because internally it anchors their own belief system
to understand the importance of doing this thing right, because it’s emotionally tied to a feeling,
which is usually followed through with extra attention, extra detail, and extra effort for things
that people truly feel remorse, sorrow or importance about. They assign more processing power
in their brain towards the effects. They assign more recognition of things that lead to those
events in the real world, and they notice that something’s happening quicker.
If you love your car and your car suddenly makes a funny sound, you notice it. For people
who don’t love their car, it can make all types of funny sounds and they just don’t notice or care,
because they didn’t develop that caring by trying to develop it, whether consciously or by
accident. The people who care are more mindful, and therefore more sensitive, and interact in a
more positive manner with that specific thing they care about.
How many times in your life has someone transgressed upon you, and then when you said it
wasn’t cool, they started telling you all of the reasons why they did it? The problem is that every
single excuse they give you for why they did what they did leads them farther from correct
action. Every minute they spend telling you about how they screwed you over, how they didn’t
mean to, how it wasn’t their fault but was the fault of some other thing—every single word that
they say leads them farther from correct action in the future. It leads them farther from having
cooperation with you, leaves you with a higher degree of certainty that they will screw you over
again, and the next time, they’re going to have another really cool excuse and story why it wasn’t
their responsibility, and that there was nothing that could be done about it, they’re powerless to
do anything about it. They sell themselves this line of nonsense, making themselves less
powerful, less reliable, less trustworthy, less benefitting from a cooperative relationship with you
or anyone else who detects their nature or habit. It hurts you, it hurts themselves, and it makes
the world a worse place.
There are two components to making the world a better place using this system. If you screw
up, you will give a good apology. A good apology has the minimum dumbass excuses possible.
Dumb excuses don’t lead to a brighter future, dumb excuses don’t tell someone that you are


actually a good person that cares about them and wants the best things for them and is also
committed to doing the right thing.
“In the future, I am going to do these things because I am committed to this outcome.” That’s
a good apology. It goes on: “Sir, I’m sorry I was late. I understand how important it is that I
show up here on time, I really appreciate the opportunity to work here. Here are the things that
I’m going to do to make sure that I’m never late again. I’m going to verify that my car starts
within an hour of when I need to I leave for work, and if for some reason it doesn’t start, now
I’ve got an extra hour to get it fixed so that I can still show up and work on time. I’m going to fill
up my gas tank at night, so that even if my kids take it out for a joy ride, or the gas station isn’t
working or open, or if some other weird thing happens, there’s more gas in my tank that
enhances the chance that I can get to work. I’m going to have it so that if for some reason there’s
a blizzard and I can’t get to work no matter what, I’m able to work from home because I’ve got
the phone numbers that I need, I’ve got the data I need. I’m taking proactive, measured action in
order to achieve this goal which is important to me and important to you.”
That is an amazing apology. That is an apology that does more than lip service. That is an
apology that leads to a better world for you and the person that you’re apologizing to.
Now, how many things in the following “apology” are really just lame excuses? “Well, you
know, my car usually starts, and I didn’t know that it would be snowing, and I didn’t know that
the gas station would be closed. I just didn’t foresee these things.” This is because you didn’t
care. If you cared, it would be a hobby for you to think about and you would be prepared for it.
As an example, the difference between someone who takes responsibility and one who
doesn’t. Through taking that responsibility, that person becomes more powerful, more effective,
more worthy of higher pay, and more worthy of higher and greater employment with the best
companies that exist. The person that takes responsibility becomes powerful.
If you think you’re not responsible, you have made yourself powerless. If it is true that you
are not responsible for being late, then it is true that there is nothing you can do to fix it. You
can’t get a more reliable car, you can’t live closer to work, you can’t live at work, you can’t
bring your work home with you, you can’t leave earlier, you can’t start your own company and
work as a partner with your original company instead of an employee; you can do none of those
things because you’re not responsible.


### The Police and the Power of Life and Death

Some people don’t want to be here at all, they can’t wait to get off this trip of life; they kill
themselves. Everyone in this world has a completely different set of responses that are hard to
predict. It’s like when a policeman pulls you over in the United States, and he’s got his hand on
the gun, it’s kind of scary. Everyone knows why you’ve got your hand on your gun, because
you’re reducing the amount of time it’s going to take to kill them. Many people don’t like that.
Some people, they don’t like how the officers are hiding in your blind spot, you can’t see what
they are doing, they are sneaking up on you, they blinding you with overhead lights, calling for
backup, having you sit on your hands, and doing all of these things which you feel are totally
unfair to you, and that make you feel threatened.
You’re not armed, you’re just going about your life, maybe got pulled over for a speeding
ticket, or you didn’t come to a complete stop at a stop sign, and now your existence as a human
being is being physically threatened because you’re in the lottery that he sees you doing
something differently from what you’re supposed to do. You forget that you’re in a dangerous
situation, you reach for your cell phone, the officer has recently watched a YouTube video where
a policeman got shot, and now it’s on the officer’s mind. Maybe your phone looks like a gun,
and now you’re getting shot. Is that fair?
Here’s the interesting part of this story: Look at it from the officer’s perspective. What is the
difference between a good guy and a bad guy, visually? How can you tell the difference,
visually? Can you tell the difference between a good person and a bad person? Can you identify
a serial killer who’s got an arrest warrant and who knows that when handing over a driver’s
license to the officer for checking, that person is going to go do life in jail or be executed? A
person will do anything to not have that happen, including kill the officer who’s going to run that
license. The officer is quite reasonable in keeping a hand on the gun, in keeping in the blind spot,
in calling for backup and blinding you with the lights because the less threatened the officer
feels, the more secure the situation is, and the chances of accidentally shooting you because of
false threats are minimized.
What would be normally intuitive to a human being is that you want to maximize your
humanity and you want to feel less threatened. You’ll feel less threatened if one displays none of
what you would consider crazy bullshit, like unclipping the clasp on a firearm or keeping a hand


on a gun. In reality, the actual thing that works is when an officer treats you like a total and
complete criminal, has you sit on your hands, and does all the things that can be done to
dehumanize you, because through that dehumanization, you actually become more secure,
because the officer is less likely to accidentally shoot you from feeling threatened.
Now this is one of those situations in a world where everyone’s playing a slightly different
video game. Ask any law enforcement officer what the most dangerous call they go out on is,
and you’ll find that domestic calls, where the passions are at their highest, are the most likely to
involve violence. You will find the logic of keeping your distance from people, activities, and
behaviors that offer more risk of harm than benefit is a universally great strategy.
Do watch the YouTube talk “Never speak to the police.” It’s eye-opening for sure.

## Arguing

Why argue?
You will probably find very, very little enjoyment in trying to educate the people you meet on
a day-to-day basis. They will hate being lectured by you, and to add injury to insult, they won’t
even learn, and if they do learn, they won’t do the right thing. Save your breath and stop having
one-to-one conversations to the maximum of your ability. If you spread your word through
scalable means, such as video and audio, and allow them to be transmitted to people
electronically and in print, then you can positively influence lives at scale and when people post
uneducated and hateful comments, you quite literally don’t have to read them. When you have a
one-to-one conversation in the street, say with someone promoting Islam and handing out mini-
Korans, you’re going to find that you can’t avoid the negative feedback. It will take your time,
and it will not pay you back.
If you’re building an idea and if you are the edge of understanding an idea and at the
forefront, then that pedantic stuff is actually super important, because that’s the difference
between getting the next idea right and not. For the layman, who’s not on the edge of
understanding, who’s not getting ten different opinions about a thing that compare and contrast
them in his or her own mental research paper, the 80 percent is quite good, and you should focus
on those 80 percent. Do not get trapped up on the remaining 20 percent, unless it’s your thing, or
something you have a focus or specialty in. You know what, you can still mess around at that 20


percent arguing with the person that just told it to you, and you don’t have to educate that person.
That person already knows, so get what you can get; absorb. You’ll find that the amount of profit
that comes from attempting to change other people is that most people hate you, and they don’t
want to hear your point of view. Are you really helping them by making them hate you and
giving them advice they won’t take? You may be making them feel worse.
There is a section on how the highest and best use of someone that has just met you is to
argue with everything you say, so that they can appear cool to onlookers, or maybe even you.
This is variable, based on their estimate of whether they want to align with you or not, whether
they see more value in being competitive to you and fighting with you, or whether they see more
value in aligning with you. You’ll find that when you present the same idea in the same way to
two identical people in two alternate universes, what a lucky example that would be, that the
person, the twin, who sees more value in you because he feels that you have something to offer,
and will be around long enough to provide it, will tend to be much more receptive to your ideas;
whereas a person who knows that you’re leaving shortly, or knows that you are unable to provide
them any value, monetary, social, or otherwise, is going to see more profit in being more
belligerent and disagreeing with your idea before the facts.
When you meet people and you want to influence them, thus have fewer arguments and more
progress and education, to see if you can display that you have value to offer and then imply that
you’ll be around long enough to offer it. Now, will this work with everyone? Nope. Will this
even work most of the time? Depends on which kind of ideas you’re selling. If what you’re
selling is wrong, Scivive hopes that it fails all the time. Please stop trying to spread wrong ideas.
Don’t aim for “over respect” by trying to take credit for every single thing that you could or
should, because at some point you’re going to lose more than you gain. If people don’t already
respect you to the degree that you think they should, it’s not because you haven’t given them
enough evidence or won enough arguments, it’s because they have profit in or a habit of not
doing so. Once you’ve reached the minimum effective dose of respect transition, pass that credit
out and you’ll see more profit.

### People Must Learn Incrementally

If you think it’s your job to make the whole world believe properly about a thing, you need to
pre-suppose that the same stupidity that brought them to a solution different than the one that you


feel you’ve got right, is the same stupidity that they’ll employ to misinterpret or ignore what it is
that you’re trying to teach them. It’s the reason that there’s an education system that revolves
around you not getting to learn a new thing until you learn the last thing. If you didn’t learn the
last thing, you don’t get to learn the next thing, they keep you in that class again and again, and
only then, when they think you’ll benefit from a harder class that builds on the last class do you
earn the opportunity to try learning that new thing.

### Debating Tricks

The Art of Being Right: 38 Ways to Win an Argument (also The Art of Controversy, or Eristic
Dialectic: The Art of Winning an Argument) is an acidulous, sarcastic treatise written by the
German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. For example, Number 5 is “False Propositions.”
A false premise is a flawed proposition that forms the basis of an argument or syllogism. Since
the premise (proposition, or assumption) is not correct, the conclusion drawn may be in error.
For example, this syllogism involves a false premise:
If the man is wealthy, he has earned his money. (premise)
The man is wealthy. (premise)
Therefore he has earned his money. (conclusion)
This argument is logically valid, but quite demonstrably wrong, because its first premise is
false. A man can become wealthy through inheritance, fraud, winning the lottery, etc.
Even if you shouldn’t be effective, the stupid people still believe you. One could imagine that
it’s abuse of the common human misconceptions such as ad hominem and appeal to authority
and other biases; sunk cost fallacy and such.

### It’s Hard to Be Open to New Ideas

If you select a group of stupid people, there are things that they’re incapable of learning. Even
if they were capable of learning, there are prerequisites that they need to understand in order to
employ the knowledge. To hope that they’ve met the prerequisites and that today is the day that
they’re ready to receive the information, presented it in a way that they’ve never seen before, that
they haven’t already discounted, misconstrued, or become immune to, for all of those things to
align, for you to be the day, the minute and the moment and the bearer of truth and change for


that person, is often futile. That may be the reason that so few Republicans go into arguments
with Democrats and leave, having changed parties. If you were to chart all of the political
conversations that have ever occurred, and chart how many of those conversations resulted in a
genuine belief change, you’d find it to be shockingly low. This is why, for some reason, people
who vote Republican tend to stay that way for the rest of their lives, and people who vote
Democrat tend to stay that way for the rest of their lives; because whatever immunity to new
facts and ways of believing things they had when they came in, they keep for a lifetime.
The point is, don’t live your life as a blocker of ideas and don’t live your life as a problem
solver of other people’s problems, because you will be restricted by what problems they think
matter and what they’re aware of, particularly people that are overly conceited or arrogant and
full of themselves that just happen to be wrong as well. That’s the worst of all worlds.
If you’ve got a bad personality and you’re still productive, effective and useful, we’re willing
to pay the personality price. However, if you’ve got a bad personality and you’re spreading the
wrong ideas in the wrong way and causing the world to be a worse place, that’s not a good place
to be. If you look at a lot of political arguments and the way they’re structured, with the ad
hominem attacks and the assumption of worse motive and intention, there’s somebody on one
side of the argument doing real bad for the planet. You can argue the right things the wrong way.
You can try to achieve the right goals with the wrong methods, and end up doing more harm than
good.

### Two People Can See the Same Data Differently

When you disregard specificity, you end up in arguments with people you actually agree with.
There’s a law where by which two logical people given the same data will always arrive at the
same conclusions. The only way it doesn’t occur is if one of them is not logical, that’s it. What
happens in this world of intelligent smart people, some choose a different set of facts than others,
some have hidden objectives that they’re trying to achieve, that they’re not aware of, and some
of them just don’t speak with enough specificity to exclude the arguments close to their own, but
not others’. Then, they have to defend positions that are not theirs. If people are more careful
with words, more mindful of their objectives, then some of the smartest people of the world
could come to more consensus of the correct paths. At least if not coming to consensus on a path,
coming to consensus on “yes, a person that believes these things should choose for this, and we


will both amend and update our decisions if we can discover better prices, better evidence, and
better input for us to manipulate for better output.”

### Outstanding Claims Require Outstanding Evidence

A good saying is, “outstanding claims require outstanding evidence.” Thus, if you think that
you know something rare and insane has happened, you should require rather rare and insane
proof of it happening, because you care about Bayes theorem and you accurately know that you
must look at the likelihood that something is actually happening or not, and therefore modify
what you require as evidence. Therefore, your evidence required for a rare thing must be much
larger and much harder to pass than the evidence required for things that are common.

### Hitchens’s Razor

“Hitchens’s razor” is an epistemological razor (a principle or rule of thumb that allows one to
quickly eliminate nonsensical explanations for a phenomenon, or avoid unnecessary actions)
expressed by writer Christopher Hitchens. It says that the burden of proof regarding the
truthfulness of a claim lies with the one who makes the claim. If this burden is not met, then the
claim has no merit, and its opponents need not argue further in order to dismiss it.
Hitchens has phrased the razor in writing as, “What can be asserted without evidence can also
be dismissed without evidence.”

### Beware the Dunning-Kruger Effect

The Dunning-Kruger effect is a type of cognitive bias in which people believe that they are
smarter and more capable than they really are. This is because people of low ability do not
possess the insight needed to recognize their own incompetence. The combination of low
cognitive ability and lack of self-awareness leads them to overestimate their own capabilities.
Stop trying to educate fools, there’s no profit in it. If you win, then you lose because they may
despise you. If you lose, you’ve lost an argument to an idiot.
Be smart enough to lose an argument and learn something. Scivive can never figure out why
people don’t respect intellect more. It is as though when arguing about an idea, people care so
much about thinking they’ve won the argument that they can’t learn. They care more about


looking right than learning a new thing. That is why so often you will see truly well-spoken and
knowledgeable people being talked down to and yelled at by idiots, because the idiots are so
short-sighted as to see the only goal as appearing to win an argument, not making a powerful
intelligent friend, or really trying to change their mind, or even learning themselves. They’re
only interested in the shortest goal they can visualize, which is to appear to win this argument
right now, in front of these people.

### The Vicious Circle of Stupidity.........................................................................................

If only the stupid were smarter, they’d know enough that there’s often an opportunity to learn
from a skilled opponent instead of saying the same things over and over again every time a
subject comes up. If you have a good memory, you will more quickly tire of saying the same
things over and over again, because they are fresher in the mind of someone who remembers
how short a time ago you had to use the same arguments. Being reasonable and better at winning
arguments by assuming someone else’s best argument and improving its presentation is possible.
Honor the feelings, not the words. What would make you feel I understand you?

### Debates

Hitchens’s debate tactics included ingratiating himself to his audience. “Isn’t it wonderful to
have such people volunteering to hear about X on such a wonderful night? That is to say, I won’t
speak to a captive audience, so anyone not here voluntarily, please leave now. I like the people of
X because of Y good thing.”
Dress up like a really old dude, and then tear that costume off. Pretend you’re introducing
yourself as the upcoming speaker, and then rip on out of it.
Imagine the silliness of me selling you a cure for your disease called “the magic high five.”
HIGH FIVE! You’re cured! Borat tonality—stupid, don’t fall for it.
“Hello everyone, I have a surprise for you. I’m actually pro aging. I want everyone to start to
smell funny, have hairs to grow out of their ears.”
Reframe the question of the debate: “It’s obvious that X and X, and so really the question of
the debate is Y, which is unfortunate for my opponents here, because if those three things are
true, they must lose this debate.”


### The Value of Each Day of Life

It’s odd to be put on stage arguing against someone who is literally on death’s side, arguing
for death to kill more people sooner. One may wish death would replace the opponent’s spot on
that stage so one could battle the immortal foe directly.
If you’re already old, you’re helpless, and we can’t help you. The older you get, the less we
can do for you. Every cure to every disease is anti-aging medicine. That’s what aging is, you see,
it’s just all the set of crap we haven’t cured yet that takes longer to deteriorate you compared to
problems that act faster, like heart attacks.
What’s the real difference between a heart attack that takes five minutes to kill you, and a
gradual heart attack that takes a few years, or a lifetime? In the end your heart has killed you, one
way or the other. If someone chooses to shoot you with a rifle, but the trigger has a really long
trigger pull, say it takes a year for it to fire, do you as the bullet receiver care how long it took to
fire upon you?
In this argument, if judged fairly, one extra day of life would win the premise. If you think
people should live one day longer, to say goodbye to their loved ones, then yes, the motion is
that life isn’t long enough. A single minute won would win the debate logically, so stupid. What
a stupid question, whose life? The life of someone on death row, perhaps not. The life of
someone just born, yeah, let’s give them a chance.
Whatever cures you implement will never benefit everyone equally. Aging research doesn’t
help young people getting hit by busses or killed in war. What a poorly framed question and
analysis. Immortality is impossible, even our sun will die, so can we stop talking about crap
that’s already proven, and not relevant? Gravity also exists, what has that to do with healing
people?
“Look everyone, I brought a bottle of pills with me, what would you do if I told you that these
would lock the age of your body right now, at this moment in time? It comes with a partner pill
that does the opposite, it returns you to whichever age you would have been if you didn’t take
the first pill.” What would you pay for such a pill? Ten dollars? One million dollars? All your
worldly possessions you have right now, because you’ll have more than enough time to make it
over and more?


That’s what funding medicine and research does, it’s creating that pill. The other pill we
already have, it’s the pill you were born with, and it’s in you. If for some reason you find the pill
you were born with isn’t working, and you’re just too damn healthy for your liking at your age,
there’s shelves of poison for sale, have a drink, have a smoke, or jump out a window. If you’re
afraid that someone somewhere might enjoy a few more days on this planet, or another, and it
pisses you off, cancel out their extra years by taking some of your own. Or, you could join them
in having the courage of not trying to die earlier by stifling medicine.

### Being Wrong

The point isn’t to never be wrong; to push heavy weight up a great hill, one’s feet must slip
sometimes. If you’re never wrong, you’re rarely right. Respecting your audience by assuming
they understand your analogy is team building. If you believe in constant and never ending
improvement and your curriculum hasn’t changed in 20 years, you’re a hypocrite.

## Positioning

### Luck

Because luck happens, you can’t just rank people’s achievements, and then assume that those
people are intelligent, effective or worthy in the same order that they have achieved; for if that
were the case, then luck would play no role at all. You could just look at a person’s work ethic or
knowledge, and then automatically know where they’re ranked in the world of financial
achievement.

### Jealousy Is a Signaling Mechanism

Jealousy is like the signaling that bacteria or fungus use when they’ve found food. That’s
what jealousy is. Jealousy is like “come over here and do what I’m doing, because it works really
well.” It’s an effective group signaling strategy.
The reason jealousy is such an effective emotion, it’s the reason you feel jealousy. You could
also interpret jealousy the other way like Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, and try and cripple
that opponent, not the right way. Jealousy can lead you to a positive outcome or a negative


outcome, depending on what you do with the input. It is more often than not a useful input, or we
would have seen it disappear from the world.
What jealousy is: “You see that other person has something that you want, and you want it
because you think you can have it or deserve it.” It hurts that they have it and you don’t, because
you have a belief in yourself that you could have such a thing. When you see someone doing
something that you could never possibly do, you’re not jealous. If you see Superman flying in a
film, you’re not thinking, “That Superman, I don’t like him; I should be able to fly too.” It just
doesn’t feel right. By the way, Scivivors believe in jealousy, it’s effective, and that there is a
reason for its existence. It is a signaling mechanism that says “I’m over here, this is working, pay
attention, and it’s working, keep an eye on me because it works.” How else would you signal that
to people?

### Posture / Appearance

You should choose what face to wear during your life, for it not only greatly affects those
who look at you, it affects the inside you, looking at you.
Why are the whites of your eyes are so white? It’s actually group signaling.
You can measure the advantage of looking like what you are instead of looking like what
you’re not in relationship to the likelihood you’ll be befriended instead of attacked and whether
you are on the offense or the defense.

### Re-Framing and Revenge Seeking

There’s a wisdom that you should forgive your enemies, and Scivive can tell you why that
appears to be a wisdom. You’re built for a society where you have constant, rather reoccurring
interaction with everyone, because that’s how it used to be. Food was scarce, shelter was scarce,
danger was omnipresent, and thus you had to spend a lot of time around other people that you
could cooperate with—kin, family, friends, even enemies. If you are constantly executing the tit-
for-tat game strategy, where you punish those who you feel have done you wrong to enhance the
chance that they do right to align your goals by artificially introducing a tit-for-tat strategy,
which would normally exist. If you cut a tree down with an axe, the tree doesn’t try to get back at


you unless you’re stupid enough to let gravity do its work against you by letting the tree fall on
you.
The point is, in these societies that we’re in today, where we can choose with whom we spend
our time, if you execute a tit-for-tat strategy where you try and punish those who have wronged
you, you will be enduring that state of attempting to get back at them and wrong them in return,
when they’re not around to sense that you’re doing that. You’re much longer destroying your
own positive outlook and increasing your cortisol levels, harming your longevity and making it
so other people don’t want to cooperate with you, because you’re mopey. How does that happen,
how do you become so mopey? This is what happens when you try to execute a game theory for
the benefit of interacting with people that aren’t there. The other party has moved on with their
life, while you are stuck dwelling and grudging.
If you are affected by a road rage incident and beat up the guy who cut you off, you never see
that guy again and you don’t reap the benefits of making him operate in a superior ethical
fashion. For the same reason that if you execute a revenge strategy on those who aren’t around
there to see it by not forgiving and purposely being vengeful and unhappy towards a person,
you’re the one that pays a price and you never get the benefit from it. The tit-for-tat game theory
only works on the other person. You have to be able to have a two-way communication channel.
Or, at least a one-way communication channel to say, “You act like this, I act like this,” and your
goals are aligned. “You act differently, I will mess you up,” and your goals are still aligned.
If you can’t transmit the goal alignment, then you can’t get any rewards. If you forgive those
who have wronged you, get the benefit of what you’re supposed to get. In a small society when
you execute a tit-for-tat strategy and you harm those that have harmed you, then they treat you
right, then you treat them right, then everyone’s happy. That’s the state that you’re supposed to
get to, but because of isolation, problems and communication and the fact that we don’t have to
be forced to be around somebody, you often never get that fulfillment, you never get that closure
of having things work out. Therefore you just live in a state of anger and vengefulness for the
benefit of working with people who aren’t there. Forgive your enemies privately and then
publicly say you never forgive, and so you’ll get the benefits of being a truly venomous animal
without the cost of having to build toxins.

### Provoke the H8rs


You’ll love this one. The reason they say the best revenge is a life well-lived is because when
people notice you’re living a good life, it triggers their desire to execute quid pro quo, tit-for-tat,
one-for-one, eye for an eye game theory strategy on you. If you live a life well lived, they get
jealous, they get angry, they start executing the program where they feel like they have to punish
you but you’re not around to detect it. Therefore, they just live in a horrible state.
Much more powerful idea than the common understanding of it is that you only get the
benefit of living the good life yourself—it’s not true. You get the benefit of living the good life
yourself and you get the benefit of those “closet haters” torturing themselves trying to get you to
not feel good and not have a good life anymore, but they’re not effective at it. They just destroy
themselves.

### Change Your “Buts” to “Ands”.........................................................................................

If you want to influence those around you, switch your “buts” to “ands.” Don’t ever use the
word “but,” just switch it with the word “and.” Test it, try it, you’ll see what I mean. Allow them
to save face.
A tactic Christopher Hitchens would use is that he wouldn’t say things to you clearly. He
would make you guess at them a bit as though it were an inside joke that you’re in the know
about, because you are on the inside because you already agreed with him. “My brothers and
sisters, you know what I’m talking about when I say...” and whatever you frame in that way is
going to be wildly more accepted. This is because he’s already aligned with you, he has already
complimented you and he has already presupposed that you believe as he does. That’s a great
way to start, and he was, depending on what circle you ran in, considered to be somebody you
didn’t want to debate against because you were going to get stomped.

### The Reason for the Stories

The reason Scivive tells you these interesting warrior-type stories is that, in this world, if you
want to influence someone and you want to make an impact, saying something a single time and
hoping that they heard it, hoping that they understood it and hoping that it triggers the response
that it should if their brain’s working right and if their mind space is right, is not the right way to
do things. Every time you read a book, you never read the same book twice. You’re going to see


things and understand things differently. You’re going to start to see motive, “Oh, that’s why
they put this here and there. Oh, that’s why they put it in the order they did. Oh, I bet that’s why
they didn’t mention that.” You wouldn’t dissect most of that on the first read. After you’ve read
a bunch of other books, you come back and you’re like, “Oh, here’s all that stuff that I didn’t
even understand.”

### Conditional Statements and Scope Limiting

If you study human compliance, the studies have shown that if you ask to cut someone in line
and then you say “because...,” you get something like a 30 percent or 50 percent higher
compliance with your request, just because you used “because.” That could be a part of the
reason why some people always like to use conditional statements when speaking. If you think
this, then this is obviously true, so what is the trick used there? First, get a little bit of yes-
momentum, which is if you think this, they’re going to comply with that. Pre-select the “if” thing
that you were saying to match something that they already believed, which gives you one “yes”
thing.
There’s profit in restricting the scope of what you’re asking for in increases in lifespan and
health span, because regardless, it’s not one of those things that whatever progress you make
towards one year, also at least equally goes towards 100 years. It’s not easy to buy one year and
not get a load of extra years for free along with it. If you reduce the size of the ask by asking for
less years, whatever behaviors that would go into getting you that one year, but as a side result
get you all these extra free bonus years that you didn’t have any benefit for asking for upfront,
because it would just reduce the people’s likelihood to want to give them to you. For some
reason human beings feel that extra years of life are some limited resource, that if we get them
somehow, we’re screwing over something or someone else, as though it’s a zero sum game. If
one guy gets to live one extra year happily, that’s not good because he shouldn’t get that. It’s like
“crabs in a bucket,” the way of thinking best described by the phrase “if I can’t have it, neither
can you.” The metaphor is derived from a pattern of behavior noted in crabs when they are
trapped in a bucket.
The other thing that’s being done is restricting the scope of the argument. If you are vague in
your statement, and don’t include a conditional “if,” and they have the mission of arguing you, as
so many people do, then leaving out the “if” allows the strong man you and expands your


argument. What you said is something that’s easy for them to argue against, which is a reason
you would never say something like that in the first place. It may not be something you even
believe, and so if you use conditional statements which are “If this, would you agree with, then
obviously that.”
Scivive keeps saying here, “obviously.” We’re presupposing that it is obvious. We’re using a
report that we built by agreeing on the “if” and we’re inserting an “obvious” where it may not
even fit, because we feel like we can get away with it. We’re speaking as though we come from
the same belief frame, so “if you believe this, then it’s obvious that you believe that.” That
“obvious” is totally put there for rhetorical tactic. In this instance we haven’t specified what
we’re talking about whatsoever. In summary, Scivive likes conditional statements, “I like, if
then,” it helps when the “if” is chosen to be something that they already agree with you on for if
you’re trying to influence people from what doesn’t move them, you have no hope.
If you want to influence people and you want them to agree with you, then you need to speak
a language they understand. Your “if” better be something that they already believe, and if you
can’t find a common belief to start from and can’t find an “if” that they already agree with, you
might as well shut up and move on, because you will not be making any progress based on your
speaking until you do find common ground.
It’s also a free pass if you make a statement outright and they don’t agree with you, you’re
rather screwed. You only get a couple of those until they want to terminate communication, and
with every single disagreement you find, you get further and further from getting agreement in
the future. However, if you use conditionals, then you get treated as though you didn’t really
make that agreement, because you don’t have to issue the second part of the conditional until you
got agreement on the first part right.
The easiest thing in the world is to get an agreement on is the “if” statement. When you can’t
get an agreement on your “if” statement regarding the very concept that something might exist,
then you surely will not get any agreement that you’re going to mutate and perform operations
on the “if” resulting in an “and then” statement and then somehow agree with the “and then”
statement but not the “if.” If you can’t get an “if” agreement shut up and keep trying until you
can.
When I discover a way that I did a thing right that I never knew that I was doing right, or what
it was or what I was doing?


I just said to Tony, “You know, if you’re ever going to measure... Okay, what was the
difference between this measurement and that measurement?”
And he says, “I don’t really know.”
And I said, “Well, do you know why you don’t really know?” And I wanted to insult him,
basically, but I did it in a questioning format so it was much more acceptable. I wanted to say,
“Measure it, you idiot. Why not? It’s easy to do, you can do it.” But I said, “Do you know why
you don’t know? It’s because you’re bad at measuring, right?”
So, no fight back. He’s like, “Oh, yeah, I could be.”
“Well, yeah, you could be good at measuring, right?” I gave him the belief that he could be
good at it if he wanted to. Instead of calling him lazy, I called him powerful.
I said the same thing, but in a language that was non-combative. But I didn’t even notice I did
that right in the first spot. That’s just some new stuff I noticed. The stuff that I wanted to brag
about that I said was right was, “You know, of all the things you’re going to measure this year,
think about it, that’s probably the most important thing.” I invented a set that no one has ever
referenced, that no one has ever existed, of all the things you measure this year, so that you could
choose from that set, making it look more important than it otherwise would, this measurement. I
found, by accident, a way to greatly enhance the importance of the thing by restricting it to a
made-up set that didn’t exist, that no one’s ever used before, but that I could accuse it of being a
member of, and now, because it is rare, you feel it’s more important.
If I would have chosen the set of “just,” if I would have just included it in the set of all the
things you do this year, you would have not cared again because it would have seemed
unimportant with the million other things you do. But when I isolated it to its own category, it
artificially inflated its importance, so the derivative, the reverse engineering of that motivational
technique that I just discovered, and, maybe it exists but I feel that I just discovered it because I
can’t think of what it’s called otherwise. It’s to artificially inflate the importance of what you’re
talking about by speaking to it as a member of an artificially small set. Anytime you’re trying to
amplify the importance of a thing, restrict it to an artificially small set, which makes it seem
more unique and more important. That’s awesome.
You can artificially create a product segment, so that the thing you’re mentioning can be the
halo product of that segment. Even though it may look like stuff on its own, of this category of
things, it is the best thing. You’re artificially giving a view of most importance through


segmentation that will be lost in having too many products otherwise. You’re better off naturally
mirroring people’s ability to chunk things into categories. It’s better to have something that’s the
best of the middle category, than to have something that’s the middle of the only category.
To set up the situation properly, you shouldn’t have to figure out if other people are lying to
you or not, because they have a reason to not like you. Basically when you’re trying to find the
truth, you want to set the game up so that they would win by lying, that you would know what a
lie would look like, and that you set the situation up where you get them to do that thing that
would profit them. In reality, it doesn’t profit them, because you were hiding that fact from them
that once they did the thing that they thought would work for them but what you knew was a lie,
then they failed the test.

### Framing and Controlling Perception

Lying about why you go to the gym: Isn’t it funny that the only reason anyone ever works out
is for themselves, and not for any reason that someone might give them stuff for?
Visiting a therapist, where you go and talk about negative ideas all the time, to try to analyze
the hardships is interesting. Maybe if you talked about what was good and what you wanted, that
would be where your consciousness went. If you schedule a time to talk about everything you
don’t want, you’re going to find that you notice a lot of stuff you don’t want; maybe stuff you
wouldn’t be noticing and would have forgotten about long ago, if you changed the meanings to
something positive, and were so busy doing awesome things that you didn’t have time to think
about the negative. The hardship exists for everybody, if you empower it, if you look upon it,
then you feel it whether it’s there or not.
If you go up to your friend and you say, “Why do you look sad today?” you just hurt your
friend. Your friend doesn’t know whether he appears sad or not. You might have just forced your
friend to look sad. If you say, “Why are you so angry? Why are you so angry right now?” You’re
crushing, you’re forcing that to happen. Now the person will become angry because you falsely
accused them of being angry, and are unwilling to listen to any arguments now that they have
measured you improperly. There are some threads of negative focus which are self-reinforcing,
self-fulfilling and self-creating. Then there are other threads that are positively framed that have
much higher percentage chance of causing positive outcomes.


Some interesting ways of thinking, adding to the categorization of human behavior, and being
an experience, is that there’s what you are and then there’s what you do. Then there’s what you
can do and what you should do. Scivive came up with another way to help people visualize that
we need more doctors, not less. You can start off with a false idea like, “Let’s take all the people
that are working in hospitals right now and have them do something better, like build mansions
for billionaires. That’s a good idea.” That’s the same thing as letting billionaires build giant
houses and make sure that none of the people doing that is going into medicine, assuming that
they have the capacity, and if they don’t have the capacity to go to medicine, the surest fact out
of capacity is building a hospital instead of mansions. If you wouldn’t support going to one
direction, then you notice that the inverse of that is true as well.
A good mental exercise to get people to access the parts of them that want to live is to have
them figure out what they would say to someone who was going to commit suicide, and then
have them mentally reverse it and you know, “What would you say to yourself?”

### Inventing Words

In his plays and poems, William Shakespeare used more than 20,000 words, and experts
believe he invented or introduced into the English language at least 1,700 of them. He did this by
combining words, changing nouns into verbs, adding prefixes or suffixes, and so on. A great
many of those words are still in use today. They include alligator, eyeball, gossip, lonely,
obscene, undress, worthless, and hundreds more.
Inventing words is cool. It’s one of those things where it’s hard to get traction at first and
once you do get the traction, you get explosive results. It’s like a diet. If your new diet doesn’t
become popular, you don’t have much impact, but if your diet does become popular, then you’re
going to change the eating habits of a huge portion of the planet for the period of time where that
little fad diet was fad full. That’s a funny word, fad full.
Thus, if you coin new terms and have the balls and the influence to get them to stick, you
bring into the global consciousness an easier path to execution for that thing. For instance, there
was a time where the term branding didn’t exist and then people figured out that it was
something that worked, it was good to do. They assigned it a word and holy stuff, the branding
thing is all over the place.


You’re going to find that with all kinds of human behavior. Like, “feeling the burn.” What’s
feeling the burn? Oh, that’s when you work out real hard and your muscles feel like they’re hot.
Oh, feeling the burn. That sounds good, I like that. Now, people are much more likely to work
out until they feel a burn.
By coining terms and pushing them to stickiness, if they can be made to be sticky, it helps to
have them sound nice, feel nice, be imaginative, have those little hooks that make moronic
techniques work. Then you can for the rest of human endeavor and for the rest of human time as
long as that word is used influence greatly the actions that people take. I’m a big proponent of
taking what is true and commonly known these days, but no one uses it because there’s no word
for the simple actionable action and malign a word for it, in the hopes that people then actually
do the thing they know of. Everyone knows that science exists, but no one goddamn does it. If
we can start to take little chunks of usefulness out of it, which is science, then people can get the
advantages of doing them.

## Social Media

### Reddit and the Psychology of Groups

There is a website called Reddit, and it’s quite popular.
Why? In the past, what you saw of the world was pretty much filtered through another person.
If you read the newspaper, you’ve read words written by another person, filtered through an
editor and onward down the chain until the ideas eventually reached your mind. Because there
was a constant overhead and chokepoint of quality assurance people making sure that they
weren’t printing or offering up crap to their customers, it took a long time to get content out, and
it also dulled down extreme ideas, because anytime two people cooperate or collaborate on
something for public consumption, they tend to dampen each other and reach a middle more
often than they tend to combine, resonate and amplify. That is the reason that collaborations are
more effective for reducing failure than they are for achieving greatness or innovating. It just
amplifies and dulls different activities.
Why is the best art never created by a committee? Why is the best food never created by a
committee? How about film scripts, books? It seems like the most effective unit to operate under


for any of these activities is at the individual level. That is not to say that it will always be that
way.
Anyway, Reddit is great because it allows the readers themselves to be the curators of the
content and assure that the quality is there.
It has its own negative side effects, in that as a subject becomes popular and attracts a lower
and lower common denominator of person, you get less and less unique and intelligent
conversation, and more and more puns and memes.
If you wanted to hear bad puns, you could read YouTube comments, and then hang yourself.
What happens basically is the continual birth and death of socially curated and socially generated
mediums, as they are born fresh and clean with a tight focus and minimal distraction. They dilute
over time, where you just can’t stand to read another pun, and you head on to the next
community. This isn’t just how online communities operate, it’s also how real human societies
operate. Once a place is too crowded, it’s time to go; once the quality wanes, it’s time to move
on!
The point is, as your online community gains humor and general interest value, it will attract
more people who are there to take the bounty and have less to give. When it was a barren
wasteland, only the very motivated, and likely therefore to be very outlying and knowledgeable
or driven in the area, would congregate there. Thus a less interesting to the layman, and less
funny, forum will have a higher signal-to-noise ratio. If you want funny, please, there are lots of
great places for that. Puns are the lowest form of comedy. Unless you have ineffective
moderators, wherever you enjoy going now, you will enjoy less over time, unless perhaps, it is
you that is the cancer, and has nothing on topic to offer.

### Delete Facebook

Let’s be serious, you’re friends on Facebook with all the people you don’t like enough to
actually text with and meet up with. Your actual group of people you want to tell about the new
badass thing that you read or saw, and of which you really care about their opinion, is much
smaller than the number of Facebook friends you likely have. How shall you have room to make
new badass friends when you take up all your time learning about the weak and rather boring
lives of all those you don’t even really want to have a coffee with?


Measure what you’re really getting out of Facebook and news reading. What have you gotten
in the last couple years out of it? What could you do instead? If you have 700 friends and really
care about 50, aren’t the other 650 more harm than good (unless you have learned the magic of
the hide button, so they think you care, but really you never see their stuff)?

### Dunbar’s Number

Coined in the 1990s by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, Dunbar’s number is a suggested
cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships,
in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other
person. The number is one hundred and fifty. He says each of us has on average five intimate
friends, 15 best friends, 50 good friends, 150 friends, 500 acquaintances and 1,500 people we
recognize on sight.

### Facebook Friends Are Fake

Facebook friends are almost entirely fake, a study found. You can only count on about four of
your friends, and most don’t even care if anything bad happens to you.

### The Selfie Maximizer

Some people are worried that we’ll accidentally create a machine that becomes super
powerful, however due to lazy programming, decides the best thing it can do in the universe is
turn every piece of matter it can find into a paperclip. Funny enough, we haven’t built a
paperclip maximizer, but we did build a selfie maximizer. Facebook and all the other social
media sites have transformed our youth into selfie generating machines. It appears the singular
most important thing to the adults of the future is looking cool in photos of themselves. The more
time you spend taking pictures of yourself, the less time you are being yourself. If the thing you
focus most on in the world is your image, you’ll find the person behind that image decays from
neglect.
It’s reminiscent of the picture of Dorian Gray.


#### Bathroom Selfies

Flush the toilet, and flush your camera. You are alone, in your bathroom, there is no way this
can make you look cool. STOP!

## Helping Others

### Cooperation and Inclusionism Works

More perverse incentives. Why must we all keep our greatest ideas secret, so that no one else
runs with and executes to our detriment? If you could make a lower barrier to entry, profitable
collaboration, or set a standard by which idea givers were commonly rewarded, people may be
less secretive. This isn’t just a corporate problem, this is a science problem as well. Publish or
perish? Well, better keep those good research ideas to yourself. How many websites have you
been on that desperately needed improvement, yet you kept your ideas a secret?

### Tolerance Is Terrible.......................................................................................................

“The suck,” sucks—and if you let the people that suck know that you’re punishing the suck
less, you’ll get more suck. This whole “love the person killing you” thing only exists in cultures
that are so far isolated from the real world they think they’re saving that they have no idea what
they’re getting into; how could they? They live in a beautiful place, because it’s free of the very
people that made the other place terrible. Guess what they do? They bring the negative aspects
over here, perhaps dividing the detriment because it rubs off on you when you’re near it. Even
great honest men are ruined by proximity to the negatives. Why do you think the police in
America are so violent compared to the police in the UK? Because the police in America are
getting kicked, teeth knocked out, stabbed, you name it, basically just because they had to pull
you over for a traffic violation.
When you work in the country that has some of the most violent crimes, and you work with
the worst of the worst all day long, you too are going to become hardened, and that hardiness
isn’t going to turn off-and-on based on the lifestyle choices of the person you’ve pulled over.
You could pull over a 90-year-old grandmother and ask her nice questions, such as, “Do you
have over $10,000 in the car? Where have you been tonight, where are you going, do you do that


often? Why are you really out here?” Ask a tricky compound question like, “Do you want to get
out of here without a ticket, and may I search your car?”
If you say “yes” to the first part, the officer will assume the second part was answered “yes”
as well, and get away with it. If you say “no,” you’re lying, of course you don’t want a ticket.
How did we end up in a world where the police have figured out on their own or been trained to
use confusing language to screw you out of your right to be searched without reasonable
suspicion (which is easier to achieve than probable cause)?
The officer may respond with, “If you won’t let me search your car, I can call the dog out and
it will be about 30 minutes before it gets here, and if it alerts me, I can search your car anyway.”

### Being an Inclusionist Works Well

Being an inclusionist works really well. You reap the rewards of including people who are
productive and awesome, and whom you might have otherwise easily excluded due to
overzealous exclusion. However, you should exclude some people, like criminals. Criminals get
excluded into little cells where no one gets to interact with them. There are some people in the
world whose behaviors and ideas are horrible—truly, literally horrible—and they should be
excluded.

### Social Programming

If you wanted to be prepared for the most dangerous animal you could ever encounter, now
you understand why we’re so social. Since humans are the most dangerous living beings on the
planet, it’s great that we are preprogrammed to really, really care about other humans (this make
them less likely to harm each other). Imagine a world where you didn’t have an inclination to get
along with your fellow man. If they could get away with it, perhaps they just kill you when no
one is looking, to see what it’s like to watch a man die. The takeaway is that not only is social
stuff great for teamwork, but it’s great for survival. If you hear a bump in the night, the worst
case is that it’s another human, more so than a wild animal is.

### True Responsibility - A Tony Robbins Story


Tony Robbins told a story about a guy who was in a terrible motorcycle accident, became a
paraplegic, was burned over 80 percent of his body, and could only use one arm. He’s harsh and
insanely hard, his father was hard on him, and his father made him accept responsibility for stuff
that truly didn’t seem fair, things that obviously weren’t his fault, and weren’t his problem.
One day he borrowed his father’s car and someone rear-ended him. His father made him pay
to fix it, and that didn’t seem fair to him at all. After he was burned and slid under a tractor
trailer, he found out that what his father taught him about accepting responsibility allowed him to
feel better about whatever happened in his life. He chose to ride that motorcycle, he chose to ride
that speed, he chose to ride that day, he chose to turn the bike over and now he is in the position
he’s in, and he gets to choose his future. He gets to choose whether he kills himself or whether
he can make the best of it that he can, so he went to become the mayor of a city, married a
beautiful woman, and all of these wonderful things that were possible because he learned what
true responsibility meant.

## Communication

### Tropes and Punch Lines

It’s hard to be certain if that’s how great writers or screenwriters write, but it seems like the
parts that make movies good are those little magic moments, those little tropes, and the ideas. In
the movie The Shining, when she discovers that all his work on the novel has actually been
typing the same crazy stuff over and over again, the writer probably came up with that idea. If
someone were to write some type of badass screenplay or book, they might find it easier to look
for those tropes and then work backwards into them. Start with the punch line and then work
backwards into it. The main character of the movie writing that novel, typing the same thing a
million times, that’s the punch line. Her walking up to it, discovering it and just being curious,
that’s the lead up. Which of those two things is the important part? The part where someone
walks up to a typewriter and checks on the other person’s work?
No. If that were funny, that would be causing all types of joy and laughter all over every
office, every day, everywhere in the world. The important part is the punch line; the same thing
goes when you’re writing a book about ideas, it’s the punch lines that matter and then you lead
up to them. Hypothetically, in imagination, Stephen King has an idea such as, “Wouldn’t it be


crazy if a family went to some deserted place that was creepy and then one of the family
members went crazy? Then, while they were trying to protect the kid, the kid seemed even
slightly crazier in a metaphysical sense. That one person got possessed by a good external demon
angel force, and then the other one got possessed by a bad external demon angel force. How
would we lead up to that? All right, well, we’ll give the guy a job, we’ll give him a wife, and
we’ll make them seem like normal functioning people.”
On down the list. How much a part of that movie was the crazy being a metaphysical? I don’t
think that’s the interesting part of the film. I think the interesting part is that there’s no
protagonist there. There’s no conscious motive or action on the part of that “character.” The
supernatural force doesn’t have a desire. It doesn’t have anything standing in its way. It’s just
basically a stupid distraction as far as I’m concerned. Whereas your loved one falling apart and
wanting to kill you is a very easy to understand motive. What does he want? He wants to kill
you. Why does he want it? He’s crazy. That’s very easy to understand and very easy to feel as
another human being. Like some kid riding around on a tricycle seeing weird phenomena. Cool,
can you also see the lottery numbers buddy? Sweet, you’re my new best friend.

### RHP and Human Social Cyclic Behavior

“Resource holding potential” (RHP) is like the feathers of a peacock, which are an honest
proof of work performed by the male bird as a trustable signal that he is a better mate. You could
say this is dancing and fashion for humans, for the same reasons “play” is effective, or increasing
weather durability.

### Punch Lines

Punch lines are not called “caress lines” because they have to hit fast and hard. That’s what
makes them funny. It’s a giant switch inside the meanings of the listener’s mind. That’s the
difference between a funny joke and a not funny joke.

### One-Upping

It should be common knowledge that if someone is telling a story, you shouldn’t try and top
their story. If someone is selling a problem, don’t immediately try to top their problem.


### Tactile Communication

Touch is worth about ten talking points. When someone touches you, you have two options:
physically do the socially uncomfortable thing and tell them to take their hand off you, or
remove yourself from the hand. If one chooses to forcefully remove the hand, it shows
dominance on one’s part. Your other option is that you’re going to override the discomfort with
believing what they say more. Some people take the socially harder, more adrenaline rush-
producing path in conflict. Some people will take the stance of, “I’m OK with this conflict and I
feel the discomfort go away the more I agree with what you say.” What you end up with is that if
you see people who are very proficient with the ladies, they end up touching a lot to the point
where they look like creepy molest dudes to normal Scandinavian understanding.
If you want to be differently effective with some people, try implementing touch earlier in the
right amounts in socially acceptable ways. It changes from daytime to nighttime, changes with
levels of attraction and respect change with the peer group, changes with what bar you’re in, and
changes with how many drinks everyone’s had. However, if you want to talk to a person’s soul
and really get to know that person, there’s nothing more personal than touch. That’s where kids
come from. That’s where you came from. Touch is a big deal. Scivive would be willing to say
that there are effects that you can have on another human beings through touch that you can’t
have any other way. If you want to live the fullest and greatest life, you probably need to find the
best touch from other people towards you.
To enjoy the best touch from you to other people, maybe you like to add even more people to
the mix. Maybe some group hug is awesome for you. Human touch may become a more and
more neglected part of the human experience the more and more digital our lives become, when
you’re more interested in taking selfies and promoting the image of your digital self, in particular
to people you will never meet, followers that you will never meet and if you met them, you
sometimes would wish that you had not.
Just because someone follows you or likes your picture, doesn’t mean that you would like or
follow them in the real world, for you see, following wasn’t invented in the digital age. In the
world, you could actually “follow” another human being and that’s kind of where the word
attraction comes from. Someone’s truly attractive, by definition, when you want to be closer to
them. Literally they attract you like a magnet. You’re turned on by something that is going on


there. You will spend money, time, and effort, compete, and do whatever is necessary to be
closer to that person. It’s not only people in this world that are attractive, they are things to a lot
of people, like beaches. There are sharks in the water, but they still like beaches, because to a lot
of people, beaches are attractive.

### Learning to Listen

What you’ll find with the most really smart, effective people is that they shut up when they’re
talking to someone else unless they know something good is going to come out of that talking.
Sometimes you’ll see an interview where there’s a comedian interviewing a genius. Now, here is
an example of such an interview. Seth Green, the guy who makes the stop motion sketch
comedy television series Robot Chicken, is hilarious and has a very successful history of both
acting and more importantly, writing hilarious things. He was interviewing Peter Diamandis,
who is a MIT graduate, physician, insanely successful intelligent guy who is part of the human
longevity project, which is probably one of the best projects on the planet currently. He was part
of the Ansari X Prize to get space flight going, which, who knows, maybe influenced Elon Musk
to start SpaceX. He isn’t perfect, but boy, he is doing a million times better work than most of us.
There was an interview between these two, and every time Peter Diamandis would want to teach
a cool idea, talk about some stuff people didn’t know about and talk about the future, Seth Green
wanted to be funny, and as a result, take up a lot of time and interrupt him.
You can see that poor Peter was getting super pissed off, because he saw that literally the
thing he wanted to do was make the world a better place, and maybe seem like a smart guy.
What the other guy wanted to do was be funny and be funny personably—be the guy that was
causing the funny and be identified for it. That conflict between those two was obvious and made
the interview highly uncomfortable.
Why is Scivive telling this story? Because Peter tried to do the right thing and shut up enough
to not lose the crowd, not have conflict and restrict what he was saying to maybe stuff that would
have less hooking, funny points that the funny guy could get in on. Maybe it’s not the world’s
best example, but it’s a good example of as you become more intelligent and have less ego
around those that talk to you, or have huge ego, but just shut up because no one else cares about
you promoting yourself. As you become more intelligent, you learn to shut up, because when
you’re shutting up, you can learn and have more useful things to say.


### Speak Slowly

Stop speaking so quickly. Is your mission to cause understanding in the person that you’re
speaking to? If so, slow down! The problem with getting people to understand things isn’t that
you’re not spitting enough data at them, it’s that they need to understand it better. The faster you
speak and the harder to understand things you say at them, the harder it gets.
Notice the word “at,” You may be speaking “at” someone if the ideas are bouncing off and
making it harder instead of easier for them to understand. Maybe we should use the word “to,”
not because it’s more accurate, but because it’s more commonly understood to be a positive
interaction when you speak with or to someone, rather than at someone. “At” is very self-
focused, it only cares about the transmission, not the receiving. It’s basically the spam of the
speaking world, whereas speaking with someone implies that it’s a two-way conversation, which
unfortunately can be painful when one person is trying to educate another. If a teacher in the
classroom keeps getting interrupted by the students wanting to speak, at the end of the day you
will discover that he didn’t get to teach much because those with less information took up more
of the communication space than the people with more information. It’s folly to assume that all
communicative events have the same value, as it is folly to assume that all measurements are as
accurate, all interventions are as accurate, all light was the same color is a world of nuance and
difference.
For those of us who use words, just the smallest difference in tonality or word choice leads to
great differences in understanding, especially if you’re talking in a language that’s new to the
other person; they could not understand half of what you say because they just don’t know those
words. With more than 200,000 words in the Oxford English Dictionary, the English language
has the most words of any language, and as such it has the most opportunities for you to choose a
word that the other guy has no idea what you’re saying.
Back to the speed of speech. The faster you speak, the less influential you are. If you don’t
change the rate at which you speak based on the up time and measurement of the understanding
of the person that you’re speaking to, you’re doing both of them and yourself a disservice. You
will seem like a needy, whiny individual who needs people’s approval so desperately that you’ll
speak quicker and quicker as you notice that they don’t agree with what you’re saying, and
they’re not giving you significance of what you’re saying. We as human beings are programmed


to value the person in need as less useful and less powerful than the person who is reactive and
comes from a space of fulfillment.
What’s the downside to this? The downside to this is that it allows dumb people, who don’t
have anything to say, but learn to say it in a deep voice and slowly, to take lots more respect and
influence than they deserve to, because we’re all programmed to respond to that style of
interaction. It’s an unfortunate consequence of powerfulness of speaking slowly that today rates
are artificially slow and the time must be wasted honoring ideas that aren’t great in order to buy
compliance and influence for the ideas that could be considered great.
Trust used to be much, much more valuable, and the rates at which you could check people’s
trustworthiness were much lower. Progress in recording technology and transportation speed has
made trustworthiness less valuable, because now we can verify things in real time. At least, most
of them.

### Dealing with Moderators

Since they get attacked all day long, any suggestion you make will be considered an attack.
The default position is that you are the enemy. Only lots of ass kissing seems to work with these
folks. Chances are, if you’re speaking to a moderator at all, you’re probably going to have a bad
time. Like the police of the real world, when you deal with assholes all day, it tends to affect
your demeanor negatively.

### Writing

There’s no such thing as writers, only dreamers.
The writing is but the means to the end of sharing ones dreams with the world.
If you don’t want to write, but you like arguing with people, try pretending that you are
arguing against yourself. You might be able to trigger the reward that comes from thinking
you’re gaining social value, but really you’re just gaining value against yourself.

### Ambiguity in Communication

Ambiguity is your friend, and the advertisement that peaks interest has an unanswered
question, a curiosity that only a visit or purchase can solve.


It’s the same as when you’re texting people or trying to have an influence. What they don’t
know and what they imagined is at least as powerful and at least as compelling, because it’s
already in their head and from themselves, as anything that you try to transmit. Whatever you
transmit, you’re lucky if it gets received, processed, and has the effect that you hoped.
If it comes from them, it doesn’t need to be received, doesn’t need processed, doesn’t need to
go through the same filters that your output does. It’s faster, works better, and it’s cleaner.
Scivive would call it mental negative space. The blanks that they fill in that you set the
framework around, but they really painted in the boxes. Paint by numbers—you’re setting up the
numbers and they’re doing the painting.

### The Idea Came From Them

There’s a saying that “It’s much easier to fool a man than to show a man that he’s been
fooled.” It’s that same; did they fill in the blanks, did they fill in the negative space? Now you
combine the concept, the idea that they think came from them, they have to defend and fight for,
because it came from them, so it’s got to be good or people will like them less. That’s why it’s
easier to fool people than it is to show them they’ve been fooled.

### Pattern Interrupts—the Escape Hatch to Better Feelings

There’s nothing like the self-awareness that comes from doing a ninja roll off your bike from
hitting an unexpected curb or whatever. Nothing like hitting a curb and being like “Yep, ninja
roll, meant to do that stuff, meant to totally roll off the bike here.” You’re doing something
you’re used to doing, and when something unexpected happens, it breaks you out of your normal
pattern and gives you the chance to see the world in a new way, perhaps a view of the sky from
the pavement.
You can use pattern interrupts to stop people from running the same disempowering patterns
they’re used to. For instance, if someone is about to go into their terrible story about how life is
so unfair to them, you could ask them, “I’m really interested in that, can you tell me real quick,
have you ever drank pizza through a straw?” Then give them a little playful push, or tap,
whatever it takes to reset them off the old disempowering path. A reset gives you a chance to


stick something better in there. It’s important to follow up with a new good path. You only open
the door, you have to get them to step through, lead them to a better place.

### Bosses

Because our perceptions are so easily influenced by what we want to believe, it’s very easy
for bosses and employees to work together better. This is because the boss can tell you what you
should do. Because he doesn’t have to do it, he can be truthful about what you should do. But
you, the worker, actually has to do the task. You care a little bit less about what you should do
and more about what you can kind of get away with or would be good enough to remain
employed. For people who actually need to do the work best is often not an option, but for
people who can sit in fancy chairs and just dream up tasks for faceless masses to just do. You
know for those best is a lot more affordable, emotionally.

### Demand Respect

Demand respect, even if indirectly. You can pay people to do as you wish even if they don’t
respect you, so respect is a way people can be influenced for free-ish.
If you want to move a man, you must already know what he is moved by.
If you know what already influences someone, you can bridge that to what new thing you
want to have influence on them. This is the same way that we peg new understanding to things
already understood. In this case, we’re just switching understanding for influence. We peg the
new influences to the sites where the old influences were docked, or if they’re useful, we dock
right on top of them.

### If You Speak the Language of the Masses, You Can Reach Billions

I had my sights set on writing the best self-help book, and using Think and Grow Rich;
Richest Man of Babylon; How to Win Friends and Influence People; The Secret; Rich Dad, Poor
Dad; Four Hour Work Week, and others as benchmarks for the maximum impact that you could
have in the self-help space. Now, through the deep study of what is possible, what does exist and
what has existed, I see that you can reach billions of people instead of millions; you can engage
them for hundreds of hours instead of a couple, and that you can addict them 10 times harder, if


only you speak the language that they speak; the language of fiction, the language of myth, the
arc of story, a relatable protagonist—the language that human beings have been programmed to
be receptive to since before the written word existed.
Stories have existed since long before writing was invented. Speech has existed for longer
than writing and social structure, respect, reciprocity and knowing what’s important and what’s
not, feeling fear and not, and feeling that you’re a member of something greater than yourself.
Altruism precedes history, writing, and likely precedes much of math, probably anything past
addition and subtraction.
If you actually care about making the most impact on the people of this planet, at this time,
you need to speak the language that they speak and that they prove that they are most receptive
to. Sadly, that language is not an honest language. Sadly that language is a very convoluted, very
abstracted imaginary language. It’s the language of things that never happened. What if you were
to measure the conscious input that goes into human’s brains and measure the ratio of things that
actually happened and things that didn’t happen? You may find that that which didn’t happen is a
huge component.
Back when I was having a conversation with a friend about how to get people to stop
rejecting and instead start accepting ideas or advice—they never did it, because they had a chip
on their shoulder—I figured out that the way to do it was by storytelling. You tell a parable or a
story that’s not about them and not about you, but proves a point some other way, just like a joke
with a punch line. For example, a nurse is walking through the hospital, and she pulls a rectal
thermometer out of her coat pocket and goes, “Damn it! Someone has my pen!” There’s some
other version of that joke where, basically it injects into your brain the punch line that her pen is
up somebody’s ass because she has a thermometer in her pocket that she was supposed to be
taking someone’s temperature with.
The concept is that you can tell someone a story, they follow along, and then you hit them
with the punch line, which causes them to understand all at once, without them being able to
avoid or reject the point. They are prevented from using mental tactics that they would normally
use to avoid getting an idea, or being caught getting the idea.
Do you read fiction? Do you listen to music? These things are not facts in the objective
world. These are permutations and combinations of human created things, and thus you’re going
to end up with a canon of work with an enemy, a hero, a path, learning, self-discovery and


betrayal and all of the other successful addictive tropes, hopefully combined with accurate,
educational, effective badass action performed by the protagonists.

### Knowing Specifics Before Universals

The intelligent people only want to build and promote ideas and show how ideas are the
universal frameworks that underlie things. However, just like martial arts class, they teach you
the katas (the Japanese word meaning literally “form,” referring to a detailed choreographed
pattern of martial arts movements), they teach you the strategies that you can use, and they teach
them in individualities. They don’t teach you the universal that they use to then permute out into
the strategies, because they’re too vague and they’re too un-actionable. It’s through the same
vague and un-actionality of knowing universals before specifics.
Vagueness and un-action-ability is the densest, easiest to manipulate, greatest way for some
intellectual people to think about things. For others that don’t have the capacity to write their
own self-help books or haven’t had a decade to spend learning cool and interesting things
however, to assume that the densest format would help everyone else just the same is obviously
false. What’s going to help those people is to not see the underlying universals. Maybe you could
mention the underlying details in passing if you wish to. You need to focus on the things that can
fit in their brain, mesh with the mind space they come from, and are actionable.

### You Don’t Make Sense to Other People

If you played football in high school, you’re going to love professional football a lot more
because it has more detail and nuance to you.
If you focus on the flavors of the food you eat, you’re going to have a better time eating
nearly anything because that’s what you’re paying attention to most.
If you’re a guy who builds ideas and is intrigued by universal truths, comparing and
contrasting, specificity, really getting things right and not leaving cracks for a weakness for
people to attack, then you’re going to appreciate a new sentence or a new idea. It will be totally
lost on other people that don’t have that mind space.
If you’re an artist and you say, “Hey, look at the way that I used this brush,” or, “Look at the
way that I mixed these colors,” you’ll find there are some people in the word that don’t literally


have the same capacity to see color that you do. You might be tri-chromatic, you might be able
to see more colors than they can see. Or, if it’s digital media, you might be working on a screen
that can show 100 percent of a Dolby RGB and they can only see 100 percent of SRGB, maybe
half the color space.
Consider some times when you shared a piece of music with a friend or a piece of art with a
friend, how often is it that it just didn’t have the impact on them that it had on you? You laughed
for 20 minutes at something, as did everyone else that saw it, which is a reason you discovered it.
Then, you show it to your girlfriend and she doesn’t think it’s funny at all. Now, does that make
it not funny? For her, yeah. For you and the other people that preceded you, no.

## “Two Sides of the Same Coin” Is a Lie

Coins have not two sides, but three.
If you look at one side of the coin, do you know what’s on the other side? Not really. You
only know what’s on the other side if you look at it. It’s like flipping a coin, it could land on
heads or it can land on tails. Actually, there’s another side that every once in a while it does land
on; you can have a coin land on its edge. Sometimes if you drop a coin, you see it roll away from
you. That’s because it landed on its edge; it didn’t land heads, it didn’t land tails, it rolled away.
The point here is that you didn’t even know the coin really had three sides when you first
looked at it, you never really considered the edge much. You didn’t think about it possibly being
a coin with the other side ground off, or a trick coin where the other side was identical to the side
you are looking at. The more complex the thing is that you are looking at, the more costly the
false but normally correct assumptions will be. Thus, it’s not good enough to get information
“near” a thing. You must get the closest, most specific possible information, or you will very
likely get bad information.

## Bad Information Is Worse than No Information

Here are two examples of people who, you might think, are qualified to give you some good
advice, even though they are not.

### Women on Getting Laid


This is the same reason that if you were to ask a girl, “What’s the best way to make you fall in
love with me?” They could answer you, they can try and answer you truthfully. Whatever answer
they give you will be entirely wrong because there’s nobody in the world that probably has less
experience getting girls to fall in love with them than that girl.

### Customers on Being Sold

It is the same thing with sales. If you were to ask your customer, “Hey, Mr. Customer, what’s
the best way to sell you this thing?” He’s going to tell you, “Give me the best features and the
best product at the lowest price,” when in reality that’s not the case. It might be to tie your
product to Michael Jordan, it might be to put a limited time offer on your product, or it might be
to add something to the purchase of your product like McDonald’s did with their Happy Meals
by including a little game piece for a game. There are all types of different ways to sell a thing,
and the people who know those things are the salesmen.
People who don _’_ t know these things are the people on the other side of the transaction, the
purchasers. Why is this lesson important? In this life, the best way to teach people a thing is to
relate to what they already know, which is basically what you’re doing when you’re speaking to
them in a language—you’re not speaking to them in a language they don’t speak, you’re
speaking to them in a language they do speak. If you believe as you should, that you must speak
the language that people understand, then it’s in your best interest to use analogies that are the
simplest, most agreeable, most understandable that can to get your point across.
Ideas that are related, but in actual use, lead to massively different outcomes.
Focusing on what you want vs. what you don’t want.
The solution to dieting is not concentrating on dieting, it’s concentrating on good food. The
good food idea cannot be found on the bad food coin.

## Make Easy Analogies to Help People Understand

If someone needs to open a dictionary before they can understand your analogy, you’re doing
more harm than good.
For instance, Richard Dawkins decided to say that ideas were like genes, and that just as
genes find their way to be executed in reality through living beings, so do ideas find their way to
get executed into reality through living beings as well. The problem with this analogy is that few


people understand biology and phylogeny, with all of those fancy words. It’s hard to understand
genes, it’s hard to understand mutation, and it’s hard to understand recessive and dominant traits;
that is all complicated. Therefore, trying to understand the way knowledge travels in the world
using a harder to understand biological parable or analogy is not the most effective way.
So, Scivive has invented the idea of an ideological invasive species. That’s much easier to
understand, because people know what an invasive species does; it comes in and it dominates all
the other things that are there because it developed in a more hardcore place. In order to survive
in that hardcore place, it had to be extremely efficient and resilient. Then arrives in Lazyville,
which is wherever the species is that haven’t had to become as badass are, and it goes there and it
takes over. You see that same thing with ideas. That’s what capitalism did to basically all the
other ideas in the world.

## Grab the Attention of Other Humans...............................................................................

If you want to make an impact in the world and you want to make it by being on the radar, in
the ears of, through the eyes of, in the hands of other humans beings, look at those other human
beings and measure the ratio of input that hits them through loved ones and friends compared to
through mass media and marketing.
What you’ll find is an increasing amount to the ever more increasing digital age. The amount
of a person’s personal ear time, brain time, eye time and thought time is much greater affected by
the mass media, by the Internet than it is by their actual friends. If that’s the case, then it means
that you can afford to market to your friends. Then, you might not have the impact on them that
you otherwise can have.

## Influencing the Movers and Shakers

If you want to affect the movers and shakers of the world, then you need to get your message
into their brains. These guys have limited time spans, because they’re so addicted to making the
next dollar. Or, in their vision, they don’t see it that way. When Fortune does their 400 richest
list and they interview these guys, a lot of the guys hate them. They’re like, “You think we just
sit around here and think about how much money we have? We’re trying to do the next thing.”


And their response is, “No, that’s our job. We’ll think about how much money you have. It’s
okay.”
If you want to influence people who can make an impact in the world, and you believe the
numbers that 1 percent of the world controls 80 percent of the wealth or more, then that 1 percent
is the percent that matters. That’s a little bit misleading because apparently, if you’re making
more than 35 grand a year, you’re in the 1 percent globally. But even in that subset, the 1 percent
of that subset is massively more powerful than the rest.

## Reaching the 1 Percent

If you’re in America, you’re probably already in the 1 percent. Then, if you’re in America, the
1 percent in America makes you look as stupid as you made everyone else from other developing
countries look. That’s how uneven the income distribution is. If those were the people that need
to be reached - let’s just look at that.
This stuff’s important enough actually to make sure we got it right. Is it fair to say that the 1
percent is who needs to be reached? Well, there are three goals, and they pay off at different
times. And it’s really more than three, depending on how you chunk them.

## Influence Your Friends

In summary, if you want to have an impact on this world and you don’t have much money,
you can pretty much give up now, because the world isn’t paying attention to what it should be.
The world is paying attention to what it wants, and on the other side of that one is a well-oiled
multibillion-dollar machine built to addict, built to consume, built to give them what they want
regardless of what is or not. If you want to influence your friends, your family and you then you
need the money to outcompete those other experts that have taken over their consciousness.

## Money Is Just Part of the Question

Interestingly enough, money is only one part of the equation. A lot of movies are made for
hundreds of millions of dollars, and no one watches them. Having money is just one part of the
equation. The other half is having a good, sticky message that matters and pays them benefits for
following it. Lots of money in with a stuffy message that no one cares about, is false or harmful,


or both. You should get bankrupted and it should be burned money, but a great idea that no one
ever hears about isn’t good either.

## Learning Is Similar to Cryptography

Learning is similar to cryptography, and there are one-way functions. Sometimes it’s a lot
easier to create an idea and tell it to somebody. Then the amount of time it takes them to digest it
is longer, and not log rhythmically longer, but at least learning early longer, so that an hour of
your speaking might be six to eight hours of their understanding and depending on the difficulty
of the material, they may never understand. They may not have the tools that would be requisite
beforehand to have truly understood what you were building on top of.

## The Business of Influencing Others

If Scivive was to give advice for other speakers, system designers, educators, or people who
are in the business of influencing others, perhaps even yourself—internal influence, self-
influence—it would say, “If you’re not going to execute every single possible part of a plan to
the letter like a recipe that you’ve maybe done for the first time, then give yourself some leeway
with some broad strokes and you’re going to get a lot more distance than getting hung up on
something that didn’t really matter that much anyway.”

## How to Tell Good Stories

Let’s say that the world already has a religion, but you want them to follow yours because it
pays nice. You eat for free. Everyone loves you. Everyone respects you. You’ll be the most
protected in a time of war. You’ll be the most protected in a time of famine. If you have a normal
human wiring to be significant, being a religious leader or in between people and God, or an
advisor to people in regards to the most important thing that they can think of in the universe,
which for many, many people is God, how would you get rid of the old and institute the new?
There are a limited number of strategies. You can kill your way through, but in order to do
that, you’ve got to be more than a good storyteller. In order to kill your way through, you’ve got
to be a badass killing machine that can recruit, influence, control and maintain order with other
badass killing machines to kill so many people that the people that are left are thinking “You


know what? I would rather believe this new cool story and stay alive than believe the old cool
story.” And, it’s funny if you think about what it takes to worship most religions.
They promise you the sun, the stars, the moon, eternal ecstasy in a place that’s so good it can’t
even be described. They promise those things to you.
It’s advance-fee fraud. It’s a Nigerian scam. Their cousin has a billion, zillion dollars that
they’re going to give to you for some weird reason they made up, you just need to give them the
money to pay the Western Union guy off, or to pay the public official off, or whatever excuse it
takes to get you to give in order that you should receive in the future this thing that you have
assigned value to.
Guess what? A “confidence man,” a con artist, is not someone who gains your confidence;
that’s a misunderstanding. A confidence artist gives you confidence, and then you feel so
privileged to have it, you see such value in it because you think there is value in that person, and
you are privileged to have him believe in you and offer you something that you will pay now in
order to maintain that relationship. So a confidence man doesn’t want your confidence. He wants
to give you his.
Human beings are reciprocal, and we believe in reciprocity due to it being an effective game
strategy. Life is not a game, however. Life is the most important thing in the world, and let’s not
demean it by calling it a game.

## Effective Storytelling

There are effective storytelling techniques that were included. What you will see with the
passage of time, is an increase in the offers provided by these religions and a decrease on the
sacrifices you have to make. This is assuming some cataclysmic event doesn’t wipe out all
human history, but if human history continues, and people are aware of the religion they’re
currently in and the religions that existed previously, if you want to out-compete the religion that
people are already in, which almost everyone has been affiliated with one or another throughout
the history of mankind, at different levels of advancement, the new belief system must offer
more and take less.
If they don’t offer you more and make you work less, they can’t out-compete the other
religions that already have market share. Applying inflationary economics to belief systems and
understanding that over time they will just continue to inflate to the point of absurdity, is quite


revealing. Just like Zimbabwe where there’s trillion dollar bills that you are better off lighting on
fire for warmth than you are trying to buy anything with, that’s the result of needing to
continuously increase the fantasy pay off of the fantasy work that people are doing.

## Be Proud of What You Invented

It’s really fun to be proud of what you came up with, what you invented, and what’s novel
that you did. It gives you a sense of significance, importance and achievement, and that’s
fabulous.
On the other hand, if you’re in the business of influencing other people, such as the education
business or the motivation business—maybe what your clients and your customers and your
students need isn’t what you have uniquely created, which is a very, very small subset of all the
things that have been created before you and after that act of creation. We could call it
procreation, then it would be better for you and your students that listen to you and are
influenced by you to be exposed to a message that they need to hear, regardless of whether
you’re the originator of it or not.
It would be a terrible tragedy for math teachers to not teach algebra, addition, or subtraction
because they didn’t invent them. To only talk about this new thing that you could never even
understand, that’s at the limit of understanding because you were deprived of the prerequisites of
understanding it, because no one wanted to teach it to you, because the people talking to you
didn’t invent them. The people that invented them are long dead.

## A Thousand Different Techniques

The most important part of writing a book isn’t to present all the data you have on a thing,
because in an ideal world, where one has a ton of memory and access to the internet, the reader
already has access to everything in the world. What they need from you is less, not more. They
don’t need more data, they need less data. You need to refine and hone their limited attention
span on something that is truly beneficial to them, not to tell them a million things to confuse the
issue. You don’t need to learn from the man who can do a thousand different techniques, you
need to learn from the man who can do one very well.

## Give People What They Need


Giving people what they want is not giving them what they need. Giving them what they want
is making them fat, killing them, addicting them, and making them non-creative and non-
productive.

## Effective Communication

Over complicating things to look smart is the opposite of being smart. Use the cheaper word.
It’s hard enough to get people do anything in this world, especially if I have to Google what you
have said.

## The Giving Pledge

Regarding The Giving Pledge, it’s good enough for the richest people in the world to try and
influence their peers, and influence you. If you want to have an impact on this world, you can do
it through a business, that will get you millions, it’s how you can legally control other people’s
lives, not just your employees. You control their lives, and you choose how they spend during
their day. If you give them work, a good work environment, and a good goal, you can really
enrich their lives and make them feel pride, make them feel good. Let them know they’re doing
something good for the world.

## Timing Control

Examine a sports player, whom you could consider to be part of the entertainment industry,
and you see how many people they influence or control in the world, other than to convince other
people to do the exact same sport thing that they’re doing. The only influence that you may see
them having is over perhaps their maid, whatever house staff they might have, maybe a driver.
Then there exists this weird mechanic by which if you make enough money, then the money that
you have, if you spend it, then you control things, but not in the past.
If you buy a really expensive house, you’ll increase the likelihood that the people who put all
the work into that house to create it, will end up going and doing that thing hoping for the same
reward. You didn’t control them during the process, and you didn’t control them before the
process, but you controlled them after the process, assuming that they’ll continue the same type


of behavior hoping for the same type of reward elsewhere. The discovery is that there’s
something called reverse timing control, and you do it just by buying stuff.

## Stop Absorbing, Start Producing

The summary is, if you want to make an impact in this world, stop absorbing and start
producing. But beware, not everyone has earned the right to be heard. A lot of people would do
harm, more harm than good, by spreading their terrible ideas.

## What’s the Highest Outcome

The reason for this being mentioned is if the thing that you want to influence in this world is
the human being, and that your highest and best outcome is to create a better world, a better life
and a better outcome for other human beings quite similar to yourself, you must influence them
through the channels that exist and only through those channels. They are two-armed, two-
legged, two-eyed, and feel love, and feel hate; they’re humans as we understand humans to be.
If you want to lift up a rock, you have to grab the rock. Can you grab it by proxy? Can you
have something else grab it? Can you pretend air is grabbing it but it’s not really grabbing it?
You have to interact physically with the thing to move it and the channels by which you can
move someone’s understanding, desire or belief are very finite and they’re programmed. People
have experimented with and discovered odd and interesting ways to influence other people. The
point is, if you want to influence to the best degree possible human beings, then you must take
advantage of the thousands, if not hundred thousands, of years of development and storytelling,
trance and refinement of what human beings care about, and which changes by culture, changes
over time in the evolution of the being.
If you think that you’re too good for above and beyond using the perfected, optimized,
thorough breed, most well rewarded financially tropes; (meaning strategies, ideas, imagery,
form, shape, timing, pattern, structure, setting, theme all of those things, which have been proven
though billions and billions of dollars of commerce in the past, great percentages of GDP) if you
ignore the presence and powerfulness of those things, it’s very likely you are creating a story that
no one will pay attention to and is unworthy of interest because it doesn’t speak to them.


In summary, if you want to influence other people, don’t be an arrogant and closed-minded
individual. Look to the past and look to see what those addictive traits are that are being used
successfully by people with less wholesome, less honest motives than you have. Scivive hopes
that if you’re an evildoer, you’re not understanding these points. If you’re an evil piece of crap,
it’s best that you remain less effective in this world.

## Us Vs. Them

If the “us-versus-them” mentality is sometimes useful, then referring to how people not with a
cause are happy to die, might be one way to lightly tease them into action.

## You May Not Be the Best Carrier of Your Own Information

There’s an internal conflict inside yourself which are amongst 1) the set of stuff you would do
ideally, 2) the set of stuff you’ll actually do, 3) then the smaller sub set of stuff that you’ll
actually do over a long enough period of time to get the benefits you want, and then 4) we got
another smaller set called stuff you convinced people to do, and then that set gets run through the
same stuff that yours just did, because all you did was add to their big list and then it gets to their
smaller list and then it gets to their even smaller list.
The actual amount of stuff you can convince people to do for a long enough period of time in
their own life to improve their life is super small and probably an order of magnitude smaller
than what you can do for yourself. The point of all this is once you know how few hours you
really possess to influence other people, and once you know how little impact you have on other
people, you better only bring your A-game and you better only talk about what’s important to
you.
Scivive hopes that you’re advanced enough to know that what should be most important to
you and someone near you, is the stuff that might actually happen in the real world for you or
that person. If you’re talking about stuff that’s just mentally interesting to you, you’re wasting
their time and you’re wasting your time, because it’s not going to turn into worldwide action. If
you’re talking about stuff that’s most proud to you because you’re the guy that invented it,
maybe that’s not what they need to hear most. Maybe what they need to hear is what’s most
profitable for them and might actually happen in their lives, and you can shut up about your


pride. Stop talking about what’s on your mind and what you saw in the news when you can save
someone’s life out there if you paid attention to them, your audience, in a selfless manner or
even yourself.
What could this person do that might benefit your life? What could that person do that could
benefit their own life? Let’s not talk about trivia and stupid nonsense that no one cares about, or
that’s already been done a million times. If you want people to do drugs, then give them a book
by Timothy Leary—he probably sold it better than you did. If you want people to lift weights,
give them a book by Arnold Schwarzenegger—he’ll probably have more influence than you
would.
You may not be the best carrier of your own information. As a matter of fact, people might
dislike you enough that you telling them to do the thing will make them not do the thing. You
need to be really artful in knowing who you are and how you are perceived, because you might
do more harm for the mission that you’re trying to do in the world than good. If Kim Jong-un
started talking about longevity research, longevity research would take a hit because that guy is
often considered problematic.

## Don’t Assume Everyone Else’s Worldview or Abilities Are Yours

The moral of the story is, don’t assume everyone else’s worldview or abilities are similar to
yours. Don’t assume that what moves you and you think is compelling matters to anyone else.
You might be moved by logic, and that’s why you’re such a smart dude. The rest of the world,
the logic that they think they’re moved by, is not actually logic.
It’s all types of fallacy. It’s all types of silly. If you don’t learn to speak that language, you’re
never going to reach them effectively. You’re never going to change them. You’ll only be able to
influence them by what already influences them, and it’s a very stupid assumption to believe that
they’re influenced by the same things that you are, because they ended up with such a wildly
different opinion in basically the presence of all the same information.
There’s a fancy philosophical theorem that states that if any two rational actors communicate
in a logical and effective way with each other long enough, and they both operate from the same
observable data, then assuming that the logic that they’re using is proper, then they must always
come to the same conclusion. This is because if you have the same data, and you have proper


reasoning, you always will come to the same conclusion regardless of your identity as the
processor of the information.
The Serenity Prayer is a prayer written by the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr (1892–
1971). The original text is: “Father, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to
accept what cannot be helped, and the insight to know the one from the other.” Variations have
been adopted by Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step programs, and the best known
form is, “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change
the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
Similar to most other things in religion, they all have precursors of nearly similar things that
preceded them. The ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus wrote, “Make the best use of what is in
your power and take the rest as it happens.” He also said, “There is only one way to happiness,
and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.”
Our opinions are up to us; and our impulses, desires, and aversions are our own doing. Our
bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations, or our public offices. You’re
going to make a much bigger impact in the world changing those who want to be changed than
you are trying to influence the un-influence-able. Not everyone will ever be able to understand
some of the things you understand if you’ve got a book like this in your hands, let alone be
influenced by a novice debater that maybe they only respond to identity. Maybe they respond to
you if you are 100 times richer than them. Maybe that’s their qualification for when they’re
willing to accept a new idea from somebody else.
Maybe they only accept ideas from spiritual leaders. Maybe they only accept ideas from the
weird voice in their head. Maybe they’ve locked out and they’re not interested in new ideas,
they’ve got it all figured out. That happens to people in their 20s. As soon as people turn 20, they
know everything. Maybe 18-20. Then as they get older, they realize, “Oh, the set of things I
don’t know is actually quite large.” Specificity is friend, when you tell someone something, and
they have to take time to explain to you that what you said could be understood more than one
way. You made them seem pedantic for asking, and you have to say the same thing you already
said over again, in a slightly different way. If you’re specific the first time, you have one
statement, one direction, instead of three statements in two directions.
If you weren’t lucky enough to be speaking to someone that knows that what you said could
actually be understood more than one way, now you’re even worse off, and they might only


discover they need more info from you when it’s already too late. Don’t leave the success of
your influence through speech or writing up to the quality of your listener. Speak clearly and
with specificity; this is influence, speak clearly and you won’t have to repeat yourself. This is
cool because it works for both speaking loudly, and speaking specifically, e.g. volume and
accuracy. Imagine a friend calls you and says, “Hey man, that thing you wanted done might
happen then around here sometime, or maybe over there.” It would probably be more confusing
than useful to be told such gibberish.

## Focus on the Recipient

Not all things amplify the same way. With some things you get diminishing returns the more
you do, and with some other things you get diminishing returns in the short term, but you get a
huge pay-off and breakthrough at some future date. Science is that latter thing. Some types of
artistic activity is that latter thing, even if you’re trying to create viral videos in the Internet, you
got to throw a lot of stuff at the wall. To tell you the truth, there is no formula, no method by
which to create viral things because the recipient and their subjectivity, and whatever else you’re
competing within the popular culture at the time, is as equally important as the idea that you’re
trying to spread. People that have had success virally, very often are unable to ever create it
again even though it is they that are the most successful examples of a viral thing.
You could say it’s similar to some bands and musicians that made some amazing music and
now everything they make isn’t as good, and now the band is breaking up. Why is that? It’s
because the understanding that we have about how to create that type of excellence in the world
is either so harshly ignorant of what is actually the effective part, which is the recipient, the
culture and the competition, and that we’re only focusing on the things that are actually easier to
influence and measure which is the work product that you’re creating, the words that you’re
using, the colors, the social. Yes, you can try. Yes, it may work. It will only work if you try
often.
The point is twofold: one, be mindful of the recipient, it is very often more important than the
producer or the transmitter. The receiver is often more important than the transmitter. You can
change either of them; you can change the framework, change the delivery method, you can
focus on transmitting, you can focus on receiving, but a lot of things you can do on the outside of
what is commonly done to a misunderstanding of the components of their model. The second


thing that Scivive is telling you is that some things that you do more, well, it’s qualitative
difference that matters. You can’t just change the quantity’ it changes the quality. You can’t just
measure something with a thermometer. Imagine that the thing you were measuring was just
slightly bigger than a thermometer. Now, the mass of the area that you’re measuring has been
vastly affected by your measuring tool.
In life, you affect what you measure and your measurements have presuppositions. They’re
excluding other measurable things. You’re making value judgments before you make your first
measurements. Judgments have already been made. You’re not measuring all the things that can
be measured.
Understand that some things like your last rep, that’s most of your gain, but doing 500 more
reps doesn’t help that much. Is it important enough to do it up to the last rep? Yes. Is it important
to push that last rep as hard as you can? Yes. Is it important to do 500 more past that? No. It’s
important that you don’t do that. You need to tear your muscles a little bit, but if you push too
hard for too long you can actually rip you bicep in half. Tearing your muscles slightly, micro
tears are good. Real tears, macro tears are bad. The actionable idea here is to know the
measurable limits of what can be done, while lifting weights or in other areas of life.

## Giving Advice or Suggestions.........................................................................................

The same way that Scivive would tell you that you shouldn’t try and become a very bad
version of Google, you should let Google do what it does best and you should do what it can’t
do, yet. That’s the same way that you want to get better data from voters. Scivivors won’t just
tell you, “Hey, don’t teach memory skills, let the computers do that.” Let’s take the fallback
position, which is try to not teach memory skills if you don’t have to. Or, if you are going to
teach them, at least teach them correctly, and learn some tactics that work, because competition
and excellence has already been developed in the area so use what the competitors use.
That’s the same thing as voters’ mindsets when choosing an ordered list in a vote. “If I can’t
get this guy, give me this guy; if I can’t get that guy, give me that guy; and if I can’t take this
other one, okay then I’ll take that one.” Just like an improved voting system that gets more data
from the voter whose will you’re trying to execute in the world with telling you about how the
education should look. Scivive doesn’t take the raw binary position that you shouldn’t teach the


thing, but you shouldn’t teach the thing unless there’s an exception, or if you don’t completely
agree with that then the fallback position is this.
Anytime you’re giving someone advice, it might be more useful to adopt a menu of preferable
fallback positions than throw the all-or-nothing hail Mary pass down the field and hoping they
fall upon your most extreme position, or what might appear to them to be your most extreme
position, even though it may not be extreme at all or even harsher than your other suggestions.
When you’re arguing against other paths of belief or activity, it’s not that they don’t work. It’s
not that it can’t be argued against, or shouldn’t be argued against or should never be done, it’s
just that they have a higher likelihood of leading to outcomes that are bad. This may not always
be the case, but they’re statistically more likely to. The improvements that you suggest are not
perfect, they are just better.
You can influence people who don’t know you exist, and you can also have multiple identities
as well.

## The Value of Making New “Classics”

If you look at the distribution of books on syllabuses, you will see that Plato’s Republic is still
the required reading across all college syllabuses. Isn’t it rather odd that the most prescribed
books are the oldest? Shouldn’t we have new progressive benchmarks? Hasn’t anyone made
better books covering the same material?

## Be a Lighthouse Before a Spotlight

Be a beacon of greatness before being an identifier of the negative lights. Try to focus all
positive and leave out much of the negative if at all possible. The amount of time you can spend
disproving the idiots and stupidity is vastly larger than just promoting the right stuff, and if you
disprove the bad stuff, you only leave a hole that they will fill with different bad stuff. It’s much
better to just push the smart good stuff up front. This is perhaps why it’s not that useful to go and
disprove all the wrong things one by one.

# TIME

## Prioritize

Don’t make perfect the enemy of the good. Iterate. Fake it till you make it. Do what’s important
first, and get the basics done. Only if you have time should you then worry about reaching
perfection.
Urgent isn’t always important.
What can you do that has lasting value? What can you do to reward and punish yourself so
that your life has the emotions you want, and the destiny you desire?

### Stack the Deck

How can you set up the game to win? If you don’t set up the game in a way you can win, you
will never win.
Know your outcome, and know it very specifically. If you don’t know exactly what you want,
you may never notice that you’ve already achieved it, and thus steal from yourself the glory and
good feelings you deserve.
Realize when you’ve won the game and celebrate!
The stair climbing strategy of want, get, be satisfied, want different, get, be satisfied, over and
over is the most effective that exists. You’re not supposed to be in any one of those three states
too long, you’re supposed to cycle through them. As a living person, it’s not normal or desirable
to be totally still, neither in emotion or location. To be human is to experience not just the storms
and calms of Mother Nature, but of our own passions.

### Directional Tactics and Scope


You eat cheeseburgers in a single direction. You don’t eat a circle around the outside, or at
least you shouldn’t. Thus, when you are working, feel free to get started, and just iterate and go a
single direction. Don’t worry about understanding everything up front, you’ll understand it better
once you’ve started. If there is work that has to be done no matter what, go ahead and do it,
instead of sitting in analysis paralysis.
Do that of which others only dream.

### Don’t Be Distracted by Trying to Remove Distractions.......................................................

Having tunnel vision is more efficient than removing distractions.
Tunnel vision is discipline, changing your environment is “motivation.”
Another strategy you’ll see of people trying to break through the barriers to getting hard work
done is they’ll try to minimize all the distractions. Sure, you could do that, but you are falling for
the Meta of controlling what isn’t the work. If you saved the time you would have spent doing
that, and just forced the discipline of doing the work, then you would win twofold. Once from
actually doing the work, and once again from not wasting time “minimizing distractions.” You’ll
find that if you maximize whatever screen you are working on, it’s already done all the
distraction minimization for you! All you see is that window. Maximize and go!
Imagine you are back in the Stone Age, and you are hunting for your dinner. You spot the
prey in the jungle. Meanwhile, you are surrounded by “distractions”—other animals, the wind,
the mosquitoes biting you, the tiger lurking nearby. Can you eliminate these distractions? Of
course not! They will never go away. To kill your prey—and put food in your stomach—you
must ignore the distractions and focus on your task.
Now think abut your office. Phones ringing, people talking, your boss interrupting. You
cannot remove these distractions. Learn to ignore them and power through your day.

### Combine What You Need to Do With What You Want to Do

If you want an excuse to write your book, perhaps try out that new keyboard you’ve bought,
or a new key layout, or new hotkeys, perhaps a custom programmed keyboard layer. The trick
here, is that, if you get used to testing your new setup while you are doing something productive;


you will get progress in both the productive thing, in this case book writing, and in the other,
experiment for fun thing.
You can see this example in other places like trying your new headphones out on a jog, or
testing your new running shoes whilst running.
Now, where is the pitfall here? Well, if you get used to testing the new cool things in the
wrong, useless place, you will get more addicted to doing the wrong thing, and it will leech away
the time you would have had to do those things that you know you really should be doing.
Make your fulfilment fun. Picking some cool or fun things around what it is that you know
you should be doing is great, if and only if you can make sure you use and have fun with the cool
things only when you’re doing the productive thing that you’re trying to make more fun, to
produce a good habit. Don’t spend 100 hours doing typing tests of random words fed to you. Do
spend 100 hours expressing yourself using your own words. Only one of the two has lasting
value.
If you’re lucky, the two things you’re playing with might even amplify each other. For
instance, if you wanted to practice your singing, and you wanted to learn a new language, great!
Now you can practice singing a song in a new language!

### Hobbies Steal Your Time

You only have so much attention, so be careful what hobbies you have and how many, for at
some point they control you more than you control them.
It’s amazing how few hobbies you can really have. They’re extremely time consuming. Every
single little thing you want to do that you don’t think takes a lot of time, “Oh I’ll just lift some
weights” “I’ll just, you know check some sports” - takes twenty, thirty per cent of our useful
hours in a day. You only get to do about five of those until you’re out of time. You then become
a product of your hobbies and enslaved by them.
If you look at the Wikipedia on hobbies, you’ll see that there’s not actually too many of them.
There’s less than 300, that’s pretty damn surprising to me. The next time you’re bored, you’ve
got a great excuse, there’s only 300 things to fool around with. Just kidding, there’s a fair amount
of depth to many of them.

### It’s Difficult to Be Objective About Yourself

If you’re a good measurer, whatever you measure, it’s true. It’s easier to get truth out of the
real world, measurement-wise. Some other truths are much harder to come to when you have to
do more than measure, like predict or see something without measuring points like that.
There are a lot of times when the worst person to measure whether you are performing well,
acting well, or have good posture, saying the right words, or lifting a weight the right way is you.
This is because you are busy doing the thing and being reactionary, responding to your
subconscious impetus to do the thing.
On the contrary, the people around you have more processing power to observe what you are
doing with your body, which you’re not focused on, what you’re doing with your voice, what
you’re focusing on that is to the exclusion of other things. It’s actually possible that someone
else could see you doing something before you’re aware of the concept that you’re doing it.
It doesn’t just apply to martial arts or lifting weights, it applies to facial expression. If
someone else looks at you and can tell you don’t like a thing, you may not realize that you do not
like the thing, because it’s outside your focus. You’re focused on the thing and he’s focused on
you. You could respond to people’s internal state quicker than they can, and be aware of it
quicker than they can, because they’re busy doing it and your busy watching it. There’s a trick
where if someone’s going to slight you, you can preemptively slight them, or perform an activity
which punishes their bad behaviour, but do it so quickly that you don’t seem petty, or slight, and
just seems like the natural course of events.
Your personal attributes compound against each other so if you’ve got a really strong position
in one area, you’re already in diminishing returns on it. You should work on the other areas that


would multiply against it. So if you’ve only got three traits, let’s say they’re looks, money and
leads, then you’d work to improve the ones you don’t already have.
When people say that you should dress to impress and dress for a job, it’s not the dressing
that matters. It’s other people’s perception of your usefulness. So, dressing is one part of that.
Posture is one part of that. Knowledge is a part of that. Focus, are you self-centered?
Do you care about them? Do you work well in teams? It’s not just dress for success, it’s be
obviously useful.
Forget dressing for success, like dress for usefulness. Success looks different in different
environments. You wouldn’t want to wear a business suit scuba diving, one would assume. If
you want to save money, you should be taking your extra downtime and using it to research
getting a lower cost and buying larger quantities on places like eBay or Alibaba because it is
unlikely that you’ll find a better deal on almost anything than those places.

### Trying Drugs? Do Your Research

If you must try drugs, try to do it after you do all the other cool, bad ass things. And if you
must try drugs, realize they are dangerous. Get the testing kits, do a lot of research, be very
careful. Don’t take anyone’s word for anything. Have all the safeties in place. Don’t plan on
driving. Plan for it to go bad, plan for your heart to stop. Why wouldn’t you? You only have one
heart.
So, do your research. Plan it. Do it right, or be someone that’s happy living this life where
you only get to feel what you earn to feel through directed focus. Maybe it is meditation, maybe
it is yoga, maybe it is deprivation tanks, and maybe it’s just having a really positive outlook. You
can feel all the great feelings of life without needing to do the superhuman feats.

### Take Care of Yourself First

If you’re ever curious why you shouldn’t sacrifice all of your time and life energy for a giant
mega corporation, think about dividing up what you are across all the people of the world. Give
everyone a penny. How much money do you have? Or more interestingly, everyone needs to eat,
so you give a little piece of your body to everybody and see how many people you can feed.


What you discover is that if you want to live properly in this world, you need to be a little
greedy.

### Not Everyone Seeks a Solution to Their Problem!

There exists an iteration that women enjoy building problems, thinking about things and
associating with them and making great narratives about whatever problem that they have going
on. When they bring that thing to you and show it to you, they don’t want you to destroy it with
your simple, logical, easy, solution because that’s to disrespect all the work they put into
understanding such a fine and beautiful problem that they’re very desperately trying to convince
you is insolvable and therefore gigantic. They want to take small problems and make them large,
and if you take a large problem and make it small, you’re an asshole. You just destroyed a lot of
work they did. You just made it less important, and they spent all day making it more important.
Really make sure that it’s one of the one out of fifty times that your female companion
actually wants you to solve something before you go and destroy the excellent problem that she
helped create.

### Important Tips to Remember

- If you’re not using a paper and pen and taking advantage of the fact that the worst paper and
pen is better than the best memory, you’re doing harm to yourself and your friends and your
loved ones. You’re making their subconscious work against them.
- Don’t discount the power of repetition. In addition, don’t discount, in a lot of areas, the
necessity of repetition. In other areas, still, you might not have to pull your punches. Your
hardest punch might not be enough.
- No one else has the privilege of seeing how you can destroy people by being overly nice,
because you have had to have worked hard enough and saved hard enough to be able to be overly
nice to another person. You don’t get to see the destructive effects unless you’ve experimented in
the world of doing something most people can’t, which is providing, financially, too much for
another person.
- Couples who don’t have prenuptial agreements, they get divorces. The reason is if you give
someone a million dollar reward for thinking you’re not funny or cool to hang out with anymore,


let me tell you, for a million dollars it’s very easy for people to fall out of love with you. For a
million dollars, it’s very easy for people to think that you’re just not that cool anymore. You
could be the funniest guy in the world and if there’s a million dollars payoff for not laughing at
your jokes, that million dollars is going to get paid. Don’t structure the underlying agreements
and mutual beliefs in a way where the parties have a reason to break it. If you’re married, you
and your wife having a join account makes a good bank history.

- You hear these stories about terrible things happening to people and no one even called 911
because they felt someone else was going to do it. You learn the way to overcome that is to look
at a single person and point directly at them and say, “You. You call 911 now. You.” And make
sure that they understand.
- People need to learn the contraindications for their suggestions, particularly the medical
ones, because they’re a very small set. In the unlikely chance that anyone accepts the advice it’ll
prevent great harm from the people accepting it.
- It’s important to know that there are some principles which apply all over the place which
are the great awesome things, that’s like learning how to duck a punch. You don’t have to be a
really smart guy to duck a punch, you just have to practice. You don’t have to be a really smart
guy to throw a punch, you just have to practice it. What was being taught earlier about things that
can be taught and things that can’t be taught, this is one of the great revelations that will make
you smarter, make you more powerful, make you more effective that can be taught, so let’s learn
it.
- Timing is important. If you go to get your eyes checked, it’s best to go with your eyes
already tired, already under strain, because those are the times when you will need your glasses
the most. Therefore, it’s better to go there with your eyes under that condition when you do the
testing, so that the prescription that you get is there when you need it the most. Now, would a
normal person know that there was a better and worse time to get their eye test? No, it’s not easy
to know. Would a person know that when you get your prescription made that there’s actually a
level of tolerance at the lab that makes your glasses, and some labs have higher tolerance than
others?
For instance, if you have astigmatism that needs to be corrected by a certain number of
degrees, then some labs are okay with five degrees, some are okay with two, some are okay with
seven and the person writing the prescription is actually able to write on the prescription that no


tolerances are allowed. You wouldn’t normally know those details. You would just assume that
when these glasses came out of the glass factory that they were properly created. These types of
assumptions about timing and quality exist all over the place and people are just starting to
become aware of them.

- People thought that what you ate was super important and then they realized that there’s
micro world of amazing bacteria in people’s guts and that they’re mildly different. What might
be a great diet for you isn’t for someone else, not only because they’re biologically different, but
because of this other species of microbes that has nothing to do with their DNA, they have their
own DNA. All the bacteria and little things that live in your stomach operate differently from
human to human. What lives in your stomach is so important that koalas actually eat their mom’s
excrement, it’s called Pap; in order to colonize their guts with the bacteria that they need to
digest what is primarily their food source almost exclusively their primary nutrient source,
eucalyptus leaves.

### Organize Your Stuff

Put your food in the fridge oldest to the front, newest to the rear, so that when you use them in
that order it makes some sense. Same with your clothes, when you’re done washing your clothes,
put your clean clothes on the very back so that you use the ones that haven’t been used yet.
Otherwise you short cycle and the small group that is in the front gets used and then washed and
will just keep getting cycled and cycled quicker. Then they’ll fade or get too small and you won’t
be able to use them anymore. It’s better to cycle everything evenly.
Shortcuts to organizing things in your house could include using the same organization
system from the store that you bought it from, because they already put the effort in putting
things in the categories. You benefitted from the categorization when you bought it, so you can
use the same categorization in your home to find it.
Travel checklists are pretty useful.
If you’re looking for an obviously easy way to improve your life, take a look through your
Internet search history, see if there’s any particular type of pretty people that you look at more
than others on the Internet. Maybe they’re naked, maybe they’re in bikinis, maybe they’re just
smiling, and move to wherever those people come from, wherever they’re most numerous. Then


you’ll be naturally triggered to be happier and getting it the natural way can’t be any worse than
paying for a bill for brainwashing yourself.

### Goal Setting and Achieving

If you aren’t specific about what you want, then you’re not able to make those decisions
where they can be made.
If you get an A in the class that you don’t care about, then you’re going to see your worst on
the things you did care about, but didn’t have time for.
The people that have, through dedicated habit, luck, or curiosity, or chemical intervention that
can stay engaged with a task for longer, they’re able to reap the profit from having skill that
takes many hours to develop, remember and execute.

#### Intermittent and faster rewards enhance task engagement

It would be useful for people to see personal development as rewarding in the short term to
enhance repetitive and short term achievement, so that people don’t have to bridge these vacuous
gaps of friction. It would be even better that they stay in the rolling friction of constant,
intermittent rewards, but shorter, smaller term rewards would be the next best strategy. Thus, if
you know that when you go to the gym you are actually getting laid (by proxy of a future time),
and that’s what triggers in your brain, or if you know that when you are working hard, making
money, you are actually getting laid, then that’s just one more reason to do the right thing, and
overcome the easy wrong thing that’s always there nagging you to choose it to your own
detriment.
Maybe someone should solve the reward problem. Maybe if you gamified book writing and
have a voting system and a peer group that rewards you for work well done, and then you pay
into the system by reviewing other people’s feats the same way they’re reviewing yours, maybe
you’d have a self-reinforcing cluster of people circle-jerking each other into greatness. Isn’t that
what teams are? Isn’t that what clubs are? Pretty sure that’s what they are. Pretty sure there’s
people circle jerking each other to get excellence and performance out of their lives.

### Time


Make all your clocks and watches accurate to National Institutes of Standards and Technology
(NIST) time. Why not?
Use alarms, now you don’t have to be worried about missing a thing, let your phone worry for
you. Use calendars with alarms, now you don’t have to miss people’s birthdays or forget to get
your teeth cleaned.

### Cheating

Here’s a scene from The Simpsons:
Mr. Burns: Tell me, Simpson. If an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you
wouldn’t be averse to taking it, would you?
Homer: Uhh, not as such.
Mr. Burns: Neither would I. I’ve always felt that there’s far too much hysteria these days
about so-called cheating. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it’s your duty as
an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the jumble to the quick-
witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say
cheating is the gift man gives himself!
Homer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat.
Mr. Burns: Excellent.

### Learning Takes Time You Could Spend Taking Action

Get off your ass and do something. Stop learning. All of these chapters of awesomeness mean
nothing if left unacted upon.
The world doesn’t need to learn more. The knowledge is all free; free to deliver, free to
receive, and free to put into use. It’s never been better, it’s never been more plentiful. We don’t
need more knowledge, we need people to get off their ass and do things, and that’s what sales
people do, more so than anyone else in the world. They get you to sign on the dotted line and to


use your economic resources to better your own life, and then you got to do something for
somebody else.
General success, gratitude, relationships, peer group, internal environment, fairness to one’s
self
The pain of working goes away when you start the work. Getting to the gym is hard, being at
the gym is easy. You can’t live at the gym forever, or at work forever, which is great. You don’t
need to, and you shouldn’t, but you should develop have a healthy duty cycle.

### The Negative Space of Getting Things Done

If you picked your top 25 things and took off the bottom 20 and avoided them, because they
might hurt the top 5, you would be using the negative space idea. The result is more work on the
stuff you really care about. Depending on how far different your 1-25 really were, you might
have a top 10 that were almost all the same thing, so there’s a little bit of accuracy of scope that
is involved.
You know how there’s a momentum thing to working out, once you get the ball rolling
towards going to the gym, once you’re there it’s very easy to just work out, well the same thing
applies to developing bad habits. If you start becoming lazy, or missing a workout, or eating
unhealthy food, then it’s really easy to keep that ball rolling as well.
Thus as important as it is to show that you should get the ball rolling in the right direction,
it’s almost as important to make sure that you don’t get the ball rolling in the wrong direction.
Avoid everything you “kind of” want to do.
The “avoid at all cost” idea states that if you list your top 25 things you want to do, pick 5
and avoid at all cost the other 20. Your engagement of the 20 ideas will make it more likely you
don’t achieve the top 5. Scivive doesn’t agree with this, because the 6th idea could actually be on
the path of 1-5. However, the fact that you only have space for a couple hobbies, and really only
have enough time to personally work on a couple of things professionally, is evidenced by
another quote attributed to Warren Buffett:
“The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful
people say no to almost everything.”
A different approach to getting things done is called the negative space idea. If you picked
your top 25 things and took off the bottom 20 and avoided them, because they might hurt the top


5, (which is the direct opposite from avoid at all cost idea above) you would be using the
negative space idea. The result is more work on the stuff you really care about. Depending on
how far different your 1-25 really were, you might have a top 10 that were almost all the same
thing, so there’s a little bit of accuracy of scope that is involved.
How to use this: Start your day with what is first on your list and work your way down.
Avoid at all costs the following; time sinks, and the general wasting of pointless effort that
have stolen the most hours of your life. Those hours aren’t coming back.
Steve Martin also quotes the ascetic style of focusing on only one thing! Never mind all the
other shiny distractions so other comics got taken away with.

### Getting Stuff Done............................................................................................................

You can skip motivational stuff by just getting your significance from the hard stuff you’re
doing. The reason it’s easier to argue with people on the internet than it is to write a book, is
because you get a feeling of winning nearly instantly when you crush trolls on the internet, but
you don’t really get any positive significance feedback in a reasonable time frame on text that
you write for a book.
Thus when you want to get things done, you can either work building motivation, or you can
work doing the actual hard things that you’d hoped that the motivation would get you to want to
do. You make it easier to do the hard stuff when you create a short term reward where your
psyche feels good doing the hard stuff, because you feel important having done it. If you can
manage this without involving third parties, that’s even better.

### Focus

Distractions eat time and create problems.
Most books are written by people in their 30s, because if you’re 20, you’re too inexperienced
to know anything to write about. If you’re 40, you may not care to write about it anymore. If you
only have a couple of good ideas, it’s a lot easier to get started and feel good about what you’re
doing than if you have tons of good ideas. Knowing too much, or being too old, or being too
smart, can all get in the way of being productive. Possessing any of those qualities makes it


harder for you to focus on a single thing till completion, because there’s more and more side
interests and things that get in the way, like a house, or a family, or your hobbies, or your yacht.
There is no better way to start your day than by growing your strength and willpower. The
feeling of accomplishment makes all the tasks of the day so much easier.

### It Begins With Desire

Let’s be serious. If reading a book on how to get rich actually worked for people, well by
golly, you’d know a lot more rich people. Knowledge is only as useful as its application.
The first step to getting things done is actually wanting things. When you want things badly
enough, that you must have them, then you might schedule them. If you schedule things, you
might do them. If you do them, you might get what you thought you would get, and thus get
what you wanted.
The first step to scheduling is the desire. The why and the urgency. Why must you have it
now? If you solve the why, everything will pretty much work on autopilot. It’s just like habits.
You only have to work to build a habit about three weeks until it sticks, then its autopilot, you
just do it without thinking. It’s free and awesome once you’re three weeks in. If you want
something urgently enough, you’ll find a way.
Don’t watch, do! Life isn’t a spectator sport, get in the game.
“You can’t call failing to do the important thing ‘multitasking’” - Richard on June 2nd, 2016

### Start the Day a Winner With Willpower

Wake up 7am, bathroom/weigh yourself, walk to your home gym, Chin-ups, Bench, Deadlift,
overhead press, breakfast, shower, floss, brush teeth, scrape tongue. Now do the thing you’re
most likely to put off, first. Just as you exercised your body, you shall exercise your willpower.
What are the strengths of this schedule? You put in slightly better reps on chin-ups because
you’re one breakfast and one bathroom trip lighter. You alternated pushing and pulling
movements and ordered the exercises by muscle group. You worked on external attractiveness.
You showered after working out while combining teeth maintenance, shaving, hair care,
deodorant, perfume.
Performing hard tasks improves will power, just like lifting heavy weights improves muscles.


Willpower gets stronger with training, just like your muscles. You might not be surprised to
hear that perhaps willpower could be grown in different ways just like muscles can be grown
differently. There might be something akin to fast-twitch and slow-twitch will power. Just like
you should exercise your body every day, you should exercise your will every day as well.
Drive, the feeling that makes you do.
Upgrade your “shoulds” to “musts.”
The more things you upgrade from “shoulds” to “musts” the more you’ll actually schedule,
and then do, and then get.
Get a coach or a partner or a team
You’ll do more to maintain your positive relationship with them than you will for yourself.

### Don’t Waste a Minute

Free up your time by not wasting it (Don’t do wrong things)
Waste not a minute, for minutes are what life is made of. Time is the great equalizer of men.
We all have only 24 hours in a day. Use this to outcompete everyone else. While they’re
watching the game on television, you can be catching the winning pass and making love to the
homecoming queen/king.
Most people waste tons of time every day. Since you’re reading this book, you might not be
“most” people, compare yourself to the average American:

Replace time wasting with time honoring
Take everything you do that upon analysis doesn’t actually lead to any tangible benefits to
your life, and just replace them, and do it for three weeks so it sticks. If you cut out browsing
Facebook, or really idly browsing anything you choose, what could you use that time for?
Learning a new language? Finding love? Creating something beautiful?


The sky isn’t the limit! You can built a weather balloon and send a miniature camera into
space, past our sky. Use GPS to find it when it comes back down and view the photos of earth
from the stratosphere.

### Use Your Jealousy!

Jealousy exists to motivate you to act in the right directions! If you don’t have juicy things
you want at first glance, then notice what you’re jealous of, and try getting those things. If you
are still having trouble finding something juicy to replace your time sinks with, then just pick
something other people enjoy, and try it for a few weeks to see if you’d learn to enjoy it to.
Anything is better than the same dead ends you’re already an expert at.

### Identify the Waste

Are you really good at the wrong things? That’s worse not better. Makes you like the wrong
things more than you should. If you have a lot of “achievement badges” in a video game, you
could say that’s a counter achievement anywhere outside that game.
Pooping
Eat less
Drink less alcohol, take less pain killers
Squatty potty
Combine your pooping with other tasks you already would be doing in near the toilet. Drop a
piece of toilet paper in the bowl first so you don’t splash your butt with water. Pee sitting down if
standing up is making a mess
Learning things you don’t use
Honour your time Highest and best (do right things)
Be efficient Do the right things the right way
Don’t fix what isn’t broken (time sinks)
Respect how hard things really are (complexity)
Before you think of changing the motor in your car, think about how often other people do
that. Want to be the first person on the block to have or do XYZ experimental new thing? Be
prepared to see it blow up in your face, perhaps literally. Someone once tried silencing a coffee


machine with Dynamat, didn’t work. Another person tried sanding their keyboards’ keycaps with
a Dremel to make them smoother, boy did the surfaces melt fast. If you want greatness you have
to experiment, just respect complexity while you do. The more complicated your idea, the more
and more likely it will not only never happen, but mess you up the whole way.
Use proven solutions, don’t experiment.
Being on the cutting edge makes you bleed. First adopters are how you discover what needs to
be fixed. Whenever you can, massively favour as many parts in your master plan as you can that
are already known to work together. When you do hit a problem, and you surely will, you are
absolutely going to love all the free tech support and innovative solutions that all the poor souls
that were there before you had to discover and create, and luckily tell the world about. Ask
anyone that has been modifying a “project car” of theirs for years and years, the progress is slow
as hell and often seems to be going backwards. The car seems to get more disassembled instead
of assembled. That looks like, and often is, the opposite of progress. If you’re looking for a
competitive advantage, or want to do something never before done though, you might just have
to bite the experiment bullet.

## Drive

Focus on a future that is yours and not somebody else’s
What the far future looks like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future)
You shouldn’t care. You have to earn being around long enough to meet those challenges.
Futurists, and transhumanists are largely guilty of focusing on problems that will never be theirs.
Stay in the game. Remain relevant.
Autobiographers often have time to be as such, because they stopped being important.
Autobiographies are created when you write about what things were like back when you used
to matter, using all the free time you have, because you don’t matter anymore. Maybe some are
instead ghost written and thus don’t actually take much time out of their days.
See how valuable your time is
Don’t be a degenerate gambler with your time.


So many of us look down on those with crippling addictions. A man who just can’t stop
losing money gambling, taking the same bad deals over and over again. Well, don’t feel too
superior. As that man gambles with money, it’s likely you do the same with your time. Doing the
same things over and over again that never pay off, yet you just can’t stop doing them. It’s easy
to see that man’s bank account is empty, it’s not as easy to see how you’ve wasted away so much
of your precious time.

### Choosing What to Do (Pathing)

Copy what works.
Model great behaviour that gets great results.
Many of the concepts Scivive developed regarding influence were just by looking at the
patterns used to generate influence successfully, like giving positive and negative reasons to do a
thing to help the person feel it. Maybe they respond better to fear, maybe greed, maybe they just
like more reasons to do a thing. It’s by analysing what worked that a name was created for it, and
now that you can see the framework, you can translate it into different behaviours. Negative
space is used in art, let’s notice where it’s used in influence as well.

### Learn to Hate Boredom

Turn procrastination against itself.
People don’t like doing things that suck. If what you need to do seems like it sucks to you,
and you might be right, then there are some tricks you can use to make the dreariness of doing
what you must seem far less. If you can sit in front of what you must do, and not do it, but not do
anything else either. Use the inaction, the boredom of just sitting there in front of your work.
Amplify the pain.
You may not yet have the willpower to do what you must, but you might have the willpower
to not do all the other distractions, and bullshit that takes your mind off the fact that you are not
doing what you must. Then it will be just you, and your work, sitting there, looking at each other.
You will be fidgeting and in pain, for the boredom should be pretty intense as you sit there
without diversion, just you and your work, and the thought that you are sitting there, not doing it.


What we’re doing here is creating a lever by which you can create a new greater suck, far
larger than the suck of just doing what you have to. The suck of boredom, and living in the state
of knowing you’re not doing what you should, is far greater, and becomes far greater with time,
than the suck of just doing what you need to do.
No music, no fidgeting, on reading, no dreaming, no browsing the web, no chatting, just you
and the terrible boredom. The more unpleasant you can make it, the more likely you are to get to
work. Make work the path of least resistance.
We use that desire to not do things which are boring, to create a greater suck of boredom and
discomfort that makes our original suck of doing our work seem so small in comparison. We use
our own bad habits against themselves. To avoid the pain of boredom, we’ll do even the pain of
work. Often to discover that the work is quite enjoyable once started, and truly pleasurable when
complete.

### Music and Sound: Get in the Zone

Distractions: Tunnel vision is your friend.
Add distraction: You might work better with a little distraction.
Play media.
If you work better with music or movies playing in the background (which some people do,
because it may quell the desire to switch tasks, or it may dull some of their conscious to leave
some other parts of the brain to be more effective). This is actually done with transcranial
magnetic stimulation as well. If you stop some of the interfering things that are going on in the
brain, it will amplify your ability to do some other things.
Music can change the way you feel. If what you feel affects how you perform, then it’s an
obvious that for some, listening to music can enhance performance. Lots of people that jog or
work out hard in the gym have some playlists just for that activity.
Music can change the way you feel. If what you feel affects how you perform, then it’s an
obvious that for some, listening to music can enhance performance. Lots of people that jog have
some playlists just for that activity.
Thus, if you’re one that enjoys music, you’ll find that most of the best music has a YouTube
video to go with it. And some of the 2nd tier music, assuming you have tastes similar to other


YouTube users, has non directed, weaker videos, usually of a spectrum analyzer jumping around,
or some other non-specific filler content.
In conclusion, the tips are:

1. Click “next” faster on songs that don’t have real videos directed specifically for them,
because they’re less likely to be good, if you have common tastes.
2. Keep the YouTube window minimized so the cool and well done video doesn’t distract you
from your work and use hotkeys to click next or pause when needed. Unless you can ignore the
video and still benefit from it being there. That is entirely dependent on how accurate your
opinion is of whether you work better under silence, or audio only, or audio and video together.
If there’s a difference at all.

XX (this should be made into an app, it gives you the benefits of time dilation ((if you’re
male) (from red color)) and it gives you the subconscious focus and drive and competitiveness
that comes from seeing a mate you desperately want (thesaurus desperately)

If you work to make a nice playlist, save it, then you don’t have to do the work again, or you
can just use other people’s playlists, to save time, or discover new media.
Enjoy the silence. Your creative mind will fill the gap with music of its own. Let the sound of
your fingers on keys be your music. Do things worth writing about, or write about things worth
doing.
When you feel like you must stop, you must program your brain to think, “Great, that’s the
trigger for me to continue!” Like an infinite loop. It will stop on its own eventually, no reason to
help it fail early by not using it. Remember the phrase, “If I can’t, I must.”

## Execute

```
Execute and share your ideas
Doing your ideas instead of writing about them
Put first things first
Whatever you put second sometimes never happens.
Do things in the right order
```

If you’re making a cake, you need to mix the batter before you try to bake the cake. If you
don’t, you’re never going to produce an actual cake.
Tony thinks you should coin the term of doing the amplifying stuff first, perhaps using the
order of operations moniker.

### Become a Productivity God

Find an edge somewhere - working on a weekend night can be the difference between those
who win and those who work for those who win.
Collecting things and following through on a task and getting a minimum viable product and
getting your essential fatty acids and doing a little bit of everything to get a complete useful thing
is important. Prevent yourself from overdoing one aspect, and then running out of money or
steam before you can get any type of business done and signalling cleaning up your nest.
Showing people that you have the ability to both organize and acquire things from the outside
world and manipulate them into the way that you like is a reason that collecting things exist; it’s
signalling to others that you can manipulate the world around you. And find things that other
people can’t find and maintain them in addition to all the other defective parts.

## Persist

Do what you’re supposed to.
There’s all kinds of ways that you can enhance the likelihood that you will actually do what
you’re supposed to do.
Non-violent crime, patience
Some people are (and should be) enraged with every new violent crime that is listed in the
news that is the result of some backwards, cancerous culture. Cancer culture is the worst kind.
Tolerance is weakness disguised as virtue, similar to patience.
Now let’s say that properly and reasonably applied tolerance and patience is surely virtuous
however it comes, not in name, but in application. If you are patient about breathing, you may
surely die. If you are tolerant of ingesting poisons, you may surely also die, tolerance and
patience have their place, and you must harshly have adjudicated where and when they may be
employed, and when they need be banished.


### Being Creative and Momentum

Being creative is a lot like pull-ups, it’s quite easy to improve it, once you are doing it. It does
take concentration and effort, and your body may be trying to tell you to stop, but perseverance
is the key; being creative and productive is quite the same. Creativity is a muscle and the more
often you use it, and try using it at different speeds and in different ways, the stronger that
muscle gets.
Break the anti-lock brakes of life

#### Anti-lock brakes

Anti-locking brakes work by making sure your tires never get into sliding friction and they
stay in starting friction. Because sliding friction is really low and starting friction is really high.
Life has the brakes on you. Life is making sure that you don’t kick ass and slide forward through
life and go really fast through life and get a lot of stuff done. By making everything just hard
enough. That’s why you can’t break into the zone, break into the sliding friction. It just makes
everything just hard enough. It’s just hard enough to get a phone number. It’s just hard enough to
get a credit card. It’s just hard enough to get a storefront. It’s just hard enough to do these things.
But if you’re able to break through the anti-lock brakes of life, if you’re able to break through the
difficulties, then maybe you just slide right on through. That that’s the reason that it’s very easy
to keep doing something that you’ve done for a couple weeks. It’s very, very hard to start out,
that is the anti-lock braking system of life.

#### Torque curve.................................................................................................................

All right, it’s analogy time. You spend your time going out and getting drunk and using what
you’ve got, doing sales instead of product development and research and development moving
yourself up the attractiveness food chain. In an ideal world, the top 10% of guys get the top 10%
of girls, and then on down the way, then you have variants for people that got lucky or are
willing to work harder, hooked up with people with weird brain mutations. You’ve got this
analogy between business, product development, pricing, framing, and brute cold-calling sales.
Those things are kind of opposites, you have to choose, and you’re going to do one or the other.


That’s how it works; employees cost money, employees take time, you have finite time, you
have finite money; you either choose to do one or the other. Step 2, just like a car, if you have a
really big engine it’s going to output lots of torque and it’s going to be hard to use because it’s
going to spin the tires and that’s going to have a lower RPM max because it’s heavier. Then,
there comes along a smaller turbo engine that can outperform on the top end but not as much on
the low end because of the leg right.
What if you turbo the giant motor? Well now you can do things that the little motor could
never do. Because the little motor is already at the top of its game.
It’s like buying an M3 from BMW, can’t do anything to it before they had turbos when
they’re naturally aspirated. It was already maxed out. You can maybe spend a couple thousand
dollars and get a few horsepower. But if you get an M3 with a turbo now you know you change
the software map in a chip and it just boosts more at more rpm ranges and now you’re just
pumping out more power for nearly free.
In life there’s this choosing the shape of your torque curve and choosing the shape of your
horsepower curve. Getting more area under the curve is better than getting a giant peak saying
that’s how much power your motor puts out but only does it for a second, right before red line or
it only does it for a second before it overheats. That same type of distribution of energy and
getting more area under the curve kind of applies to other areas of human endeavour, such as
being fit or being wealthy or being happy or finding love in your life. Some would say that they
would rather have fewer absolutely amazing experiences than more mediocre experiences.

### The Power of Persistence

Power is energy over time. Like a solar sail, just a little bit of energy in the right place and
environment, over a long time leads to massive velocity.

## Improve


Keep getting better
If you’re not perfect, keep getting better.
Disproving the stupid, asymmetric warfare
There are easy and hard things to do in this world. Multiplication is easy, division is hard. Just
as it’s very easy to create new ideas that have no basis in reality. We call it fiction. It’s the most
popular content on the planet. Fiction is easy to create. Sadly, as fiction is multiplication,
disproving fiction is division. Division is how you undo multiplication, and truth finding is how
you undo fiction, which unfortunately is a losing battle. For every 1 hour of fiction creation
requires 10 or 100 hours of disproving. For this reason Scivive must speak as much as possible
direct truth, rather than the truth dirtied by touching the ever-expanding fictions of the world.

### The Stagnation of Great People.........................................................................................

It is unfortunate that great minds like Aubrey de Grey, Ray Kurzweil, and nearly all other
speakers including Tony Robbins seem to get to a level and just stay there, their talks don’t
evolve. They say the same crap for years, it hasn’t evolved, and you can’t really enjoy watching
it again once you can tell what they’re selling as well as they can. Why is there this stagnation?
Why doesn’t the same interesting thought processes, focuses, and processing power lead them to
a refinement and development of what is worth listening them speak about? Have they nothing
more interesting to say? Perhaps that’s one of the advantages fiction has, you’re really not likely
to be writing and selling the same book again and again over the years. You’re really expected to
be novel and new.
If you take a guy like the waitbutwhy.com guy, he never has the same things to say, because
he’s more focused on spreading newly discovered ideas and information he’s researched than he
is saying yesterday’s interesting things over and over again.
Why do artists and directors start to lose greatness over time? Is it because they’re returned to
the state they existed in before they were awesome, which was non awesome? Or is it a different
form of failure, is it that they stop searching, stopped experimenting, and stopped paying homage
to other great things. If you think you’re the smartest guy you know, or the smartest guy around,
there’s no reason trying to learn from other people, right? Don’t make the same mistake these
guys did resting on their laurels. Whatever you did that caused you to transition from being
mediocre, to being good, you should probably keep doing that.


If you change your horse midstream, particularly to a worse horse that’s nothing like the
original horse, you’re probably doing it wrong. What you’ll see in many great companies and
artists, and even cars, is a gradual refinement and progression, more so that just giving up
entirely on the old things, and just doing the new thing.
It could also be the case that whatever mistakes and missteps that truly great artists and
companies need to watch out for, are nowhere similar to what you need to watch for. If you’ve
never achieved greatness, you don’t need to worry about losing it. This is more of the
opportunity cost of changing stuff. If you already type 100 wpm, and you change to another
keyboard or system, you could lose 50 wpm. If you’re terrible at typing, and only do 20wpm,
well, if you cut your performance in half, you only lose 10 wpm. Thus it costs more of the
successful to experiment. It costs more for the wealthy when they make mistakes, if you look at
this in flat dollar cost. An already great artist has lots to lose if he switches from the rare state of
excellence into the experimental state that was similar to non-excellence whence he came.
If you’re not perfect, keep getting better.
Perfection is rare, thus progress should be common. If your model of the world hasn’t
changed in 20 years, then you are not making progress. What’s more likely, that your model is
perfect, or you’ve stopped caring?

### Preparation Application Ratio

There’s something Scivive will call the preparation-application ratio, and basically you will
hear, and maybe miss-attribute it, that Abraham Lincoln said, “Give me six hours to chop down a
tree, and I’ll spend the first four sharpening my axe.” There’s many different useful variations of
similar ideas, such as “Give me a lever long enough and I can move the world” or “The early
bird gets the worm.” What are these things? When preparation meets opportunity, that’s what
luck is. There’s all these statements regarding the effectiveness of preparation. Good outcomes
are not universally affected in the same way by good preparation. In some places preparation
leads to amazingly great force multiplication, and in other places good preparation doesn’t make
much of a difference.
Let’s say you’re planning to go to a weightlifting championship, and you’ve been training for
six months, lifting weights constantly to get ready, and you miss your last work out. How much
of an effect is that going to have on you? Probably not very much. You might even do better


depending on whether you have been over-training or not. Now let’s say you’re going to sit
down to eat dinner and you’ve got Sloppy Joe sitting in front of you but no bread, just pulled
pork and you have to choose whether you’re going to just try to eat it with your hands or get up
and get a fork. In this case the time spent getting a fork is going to pay off huge, just in the
savings of having the not look like an animal when you’re eating and clean the your hands
repeatedly, because it’s going to be really messy.
There’s places where preparation is very important and pays off really well and there’s places
where preparation is really just application. Like sharpening your axe and using your axe have
nothing in common. The preparation is like orthogonal. It’s like at right angles to its related but
not the same thing. Sharpening your axe and like chopping a tree down with your axe, they don’t
have anything in common.
However, in painting and in learning how to paint you’re just painting, right? You’re not
cleaning your brushes. You’re just painting. There’re some things where preparation is identical
to application and you’re just doing it for lots of time and then there’s other places where
preparation has nothing to do with application. It seems to be that those places get much more
bang for the buck.
For instance, if you had to practice opening lines if you like to go out into public and meet
people, and you use openers to like meet new people, whatever your opener happens to be. You
can sit at home and practice it against the wall. Or you could try it out in public it’s probably
better to try the public option. Learning some new ones that you didn’t previously know, that’s
different, right? Because you’re getting information from somewhere that’s not yourself and that
would be more of like a sharpening an axe type of behaviour. Again, when opportunity meets
preparation that’s luck. It’s unfortunate that we can’t just assign a flat percentage of time that
you should assign to improvement, development and then this is the percentage of time that you
could assign application. There are too many variables depending on the actions.
You can’t invent such a percentage, because of that wild difference between some
preparations only are just doing the same of the thing and so that really the preparation is just
more application. Then other things where the preparation isn’t application at all. Having a fork
is so useful compared to just like trying to eat food with your hands if it’s a messy food. That’s
another type of sideways preparation, having some type of sculpted metal tool has nothing in
common with sticking food in your mouth with your hands and chewing it with your mouth.


The forms of preparation that have the most payoff in the least time are those where the
preparation is most different from the application. Sharpening an axe is very useful, because it
has no similarity to the actual application of the axe towards its target. It’s also only as useful as
your axe was dull in the first place. Over-preparation in one area leads to under preparation in
another.
Scivive likes the idea of not all years of experience having the same value. There’s a great
comic: Do eighty one-year-old babies have eighty years of combined experience?

## Balance

Amplified Activity / rest states (crash and burn for profit)
CPUs and many creatures have periods of activity and periods of rest, and the cyclical nature
provides them with results and efficiency superior to a more constant lower volatility state. It’s
why animals pounce. It’s why boxers cock their fists back before releasing them forward. And if
it works at that level, it’s very likely that one level extra on top of it, by having stimulants push
you harder, and then crashing to lower, is likely an effective way to compound what the normal
activity / rest states are doing for you.
You can see other examples of this such as “work sprints.” HIIT training. Even chewing and
eating works this way.

Tasks

### The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with
the time they have, rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-
minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.
The way the Pomodoro system works is by forcing you to take a break, so you feel greedy
about getting the most of what seems limited, and in that system you’re always limited! It’s


using time limits to create scarcity and rarity, and your subconscious responds to that by wanting
to do what it’s doing harder as long as you can because you’ll run out of time soon.
It’s a way to use scheduling to make the time you have to do work limited, and therefore
increase your conscious and subconscious desire to do that thing that you know you need to do.
It also reduces the perceived cost you have to start working on a thing because it makes the
amount of time you can put into the thing more limited, which makes the thing seem like a
smaller investment and therefore reduces starting friction.
This strategy of time gating is one of a few ways you can kick more ass on tasks. There’s
others like the Dickens Process where you focus on what the real cost to your life will be if you
continue to engage in disempowering behaviours, and you can amplify the negative feelings
associated with doing the wrong stuff and the great feelings from doing the right stuff. The
Dickens Process is a Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) technique and a process of
transformation popularised by Tony Robbin’s seminars and highlighted in Tim Ferriss’ Tools of
Titans book. The Dickens Process is based on the character of Scrooge in Charles Dickens’
novella “A Christmas Carol.” Scrooge meets a ghost on Christmas Eve night, and is shown what
his future will be if he doesn’t change his current bad behaviour and limiting beliefs. The
knowledge frightens Scrooge so much that he decides to change his life.

### A Lack of Balance

A lack of balance is the definition of pain on the cellular level. If you want to unlock a door,
you need the key to move the tumblers to allow the cylinder to turn, only the correct balance of
height of each tumbler will allow to work, and you find that same kind of required balance
solution to everything else in the world as well. For you to be able to classify the thing as a thing,
for instance an open lock, it needed to be lined up the right way first.
If you didn’t have the lock balanced and able to unlock, you wouldn’t be able to classify it as
an unlocked door. This is worthy of mention it because it exists with all matter, if there are too
many atoms of one kind instead of another, you have a whole another material. For instance, if
you change the ratio of hydrogen and oxygen, you would no longer produce water, and even
amongst those atoms, if you move some electrons around, you no longer have the same atom any
more. At some point, the value of seeing that everything contains balance is a little tautological


because by definition if it wasn’t’ in balance, it would cease to be that thing, and it would instead
be a different, unbalanced thing.
Maybe the world would be better off if we saw balance as a solution of sorts; it’s a pretty
easy shortcut to see that you shouldn’t overdo some things. The more solution based, perhaps
containing more input variables to measure whether a thing was “in balance” or not, may be
technically more accurate, but at the cost of ever being useful in day to day life. You have to
admit, many folk have neither the ability nor inclination to overthink things, nor often
moderately think about things, so perhaps it is better that we keep the marketing up for balance
instead of multi input solution based measurements.
There’s this balance between conserving energy and finding new awesome resources. And
it’s not just new resources that are physical in the real world, but mental ones as well because
there’s always a better way to understand the thing. There’s always a thing that can be learned,
so to speak. And that progress led to tools, language, writing, city-states, and nation-states. When
you are feeling guilty that you haven’t had the type of progress and production that you think is
possible in your life, it definitely is possible. However, unless you’re some lucky mutant, you are
going to need to bust your ass and use your brain, thoughts the right way and schedule the right
things. Either have the world’s best discipline or be a lucky mutant or understand that it’s a fight
and it’s a battle.

### A Singular Focus Leads to Neglect

If you dedicate yourself in a direction so hard and immerse yourself so hard in a behaviour or
an outcome, you begin to see the whole world through that lens. It affects what you think is
important, it affects how you spend your time, it affects who you meet, it affects where you exist
and most of your life will be muted, deleted and unseen. You might neglect family relationships,
you might neglect showering, you might neglect knowing about the news or brushing your teeth
or eating. When you are so in a fixed state and addicted and single minded and purpose and
focused, there’s the risk that you have great personal pain during those rare moments when you
notice that you sacrificed much of what you might want in your life for a different goal either by
choice or by obsession; either through a healthy decision or by having no choice and having an
addiction.


## Habits

### The Benefits of Coaching

Tips for executing your vision in the real world.
If you want to help yourself get something creative done, or something hard done, you may
benefit from having a partner or coach that you answer to, one that expects you to perform. It’s
much easier to let yourself down than it is to let your friends/employees/coaches down. They will
hold you to a tighter schedule. You will deprive yourself of sleep, which enhances the chance
that you will go to sleep earlier that day, which increases the chance that you will wake up at the
right time the next day so as to be effortlessly awake and able to put first the things that are most
important to you.

#### Pay a coach

Now you’re paying to have someone that you don’t want to let down. It’s harder to let him
down than yourself.

#### Work with a coach regularly

If you don’t have someone to hold you to that higher standard than you would naturally have,
you will sleep in, and you will then go to sleep later at night. You might find yourself on a 26
hour long cycle when the days are only 24 hours long, and unable to stay synced up with any of
the other people that you should be using to help you be productive. You will be operating on the
opposite schedule of other business you need to work with, and perhaps the stores you might be
using to acquire food, services, etc.

### Keep Personal Commitments Private

This one is dangerous, many people make a commitment to do a thing, they tell all their
friends about it publicly. Then they proceeded to do the much easier thing, which is to go back
into doing the old behaviour they were trying to get out of, and just never mention it again in the
hopes their friends forgot about it too. You may fail to do what you said you would so often that


you just don’t even care to pretend to be reliable or truthful in your personal declarations in
regards to what you will do, or when you will do it.
Thus if you commit to do things often, and don’t do them often, you have strengthened your
loser muscle, and increased your loser momentum. It would have been better for you to have
remained silent and been a loser in quiet instead of training negative and training to break
commitments and be untrustworthy. The later added insult to injury basically.

### Starting & Finishing

Two statements appear to be true: “Stop starting new things, focus on finishing.” That one
works if you already started on something.
The other one is, “stop focusing on finishing, focus on starting.” That one works if you
haven’t started yet. They sound like opposites, but they’re both equally true at different times.
If you haven’t already started, do so. If you’ve already started however, finish.

### Doing the Right Thing Is Easier the Longer You Do It

The hard part of working out a gym is getting to the gym. Once you’re there, everything is
easy, you just hit the weights autonomously. Getting there however is difficult; there are all
kinds of good excuses to put it off until later. That’s because you think that you get to modify the
behaviour, you think it’s ok if you don’t go, you export the real cost of not going. You see, when
you don’t go a single time to the gym, you think that the entire cost of that not going is
encapsulated in that single workout that you missed. Not everyone accurately accounts for the
fact that with every single workout you miss, you are more and more likely to miss more
workouts.
This isn’t a way to understand only gym attendance, this is a way to understand all of the
behaviours you have in your life both good and bad. The longer you do a thing, the more muscle
memory and subconscious- driven it becomes, the better you get at it, the more you enjoy doing
it, and the less you feel like it’s something optional that you can displace with whatever else
shows up. In this life, the things that we are most likely to get are the things that we MUST get.
The things that are MUSTS’s go first, and everything else takes a back seat. In a world of limited
time, limited resources, and limited willpower to do what you know you should is mandatory.


Scivive doesn’t know which of the awesome behaviours you could have in your life you’re
currently trying to integrate, but is confident these tactics will help you make it happen.
When you’re good at the level you’re at, you move on to the next level, and you get whole
new problems. If you ask a really handsome guy how to meet girls, he’ll tell you just smile. You
ask an ugly guy the same question, he’s going to tell you every trick in the book. Same for
business, guy who gets lucky, picks the right business, he gets to have a whole new problem
about scaling and regulations and such. But the guy who doesn’t get lucky, picks a hard business
that’s been around for a long time, boy he’s got to fight for every nickel.

### Beware Eliminating a Bad Habit

Don’t take away the profitable inaccurate belief someone has unless you have the time and
likelihood that you can give them a better one that sticks. If you only take and don’t give, nature
abhors a vacuum, and they might replace the old pitfalls with new, worse pitfalls. Some people
might replace cigarettes with cocaine instead of exercise.

### Wager Money on Yourself

Bet on your progress, for if you fail, you’ll lose money. Here’s the screwy part, the people
that have enough money to try this one are the least likely to care about losing the money.
Perhaps the wealthy care more about a loss of status than wealth.

### Gamification Tactics for Useful Behaviours......................................................................

Some good tactics should be stolen from the cancerous, casual gaming wallet-emptying
strategies that casinos use. Maybe time gating can get people to write books, that’s what the
Pomodoro method is right? What other tactics could work? Jingling sounds in the “casino
acoustics” genre? They’ve found a way to addict humans to useless behaviours, let’s find ways
to addict humans to useful ones!
You get what you focus on, so do others it seems, they sense your focus and may understand
what you are trying to accomplish.
It’s funny how what you read during the day is what other people are working on and their
opinions of what they’ve read. So the more popular and worked on a thing is, the more worked


on and popular it will be in the short and medium term. Think of how many copies of the same
movie you’ve seen come out at the same time; nearly the same movie, twin movies they’re
called. (Armageddon and Deep Impact, for example)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films
This is the kind of thing that happens in business and art and all things that involve humans’
attention as well. Someone gets a good idea, mentions it, now it’s another person’s good idea
too. This is a reason that jealousy and competition are closely related concepts in that, you
become aware of a strategy that works and gets a result you want, and now you want to compete
and dominate by doing the same.
You could actually use this tactic against other countries to make them less effective by
convincing the people of that country that certain members of their group were benefitting from
an actually stupid behaviour, say winning at video games. Then this would addict other citizens
of that country to want to compete in that thing. Perhaps gaming is too fun to make fun of. Think
of the classic “pissing contest,” could there be a larger waste of time than to see who can piss
farther? Now imagine that it’s not so obvious, or tripped enough interesting human triggers, and
now it’s an addiction. How much of our disempowering addictions and habits are the result of
entering our consciousness through someone else falling for the addiction, and so the virally bad
behaviour has its “patient zero,” through which it infects the rest of us.
This happens internally in your own life without looking at anyone else at all. The things you
are used to doing, you’ll want to continue doing, and the things that you’re not used to doing are
more likely to be stopped. So the lesson is, if you starve the bad behaviours, you forget to do
them, because you’re too busy doing the new ones that you’ve done long enough to stick. Thus,
starve the bad behaviours for three weeks, and see them become weak. Engage the new
behaviours for three weeks and see them become stronger.

### NonZero Days

This timing is probably dependent on the individual but they’re only matters of degree. This
is the same reason it’s so important to be very serious about not having long breaks when you’re
doing a new workout plan, or perhaps whatever else your new year’s resolution might have been.
Those little missed instances of the new behaviour you are supposed to be doing are the virus of
bad behaviour trying to get a foot hold, and each consecutive screw up is vastly more dangerous


than the last. When you’ve missed probably four or five instances of a thing in a row, you just
might never get around to it again. Maybe next year. This trend, combined with it being easier to
keep doing a thing once you’ve started, where 80 per cent of the mental hardness of a thing is
getting yourself to start, and 20 per cent is actually the doing of the thing, those two things are
why no zero days works well as a strategy for performance. You don’t have to kick all the ass in
the world, but you must have zero days in which you do nothing.

### Stop Dreaming and Start Doing

You focus on what you don’t want only long enough to invert it, and find what you do want,
so you can focus on that. Then, you actually don’t focus on what you do want either. You should
only focus on what you do want long enough to calculate the stuff you need do to get it, and then
you focus on that. Once you know what you need to do to get stuff, you don’t focus on those
things anymore, you focus on your schedule, and hitting your short term goals. If you look at the
things you want, you are not looking at what you need to do. If you are looking at what you don’t
want, you are not looking at what you need to do.
Only action matters, and dreaming is only useful to action as long as you need it to create the
plan. Once you have the plan, stop dreaming and start doing. Your goals and dreams are really
only as useful as they point to correct actions you take. Your knowledge of correct actions are
only as useful as you can actually act on them.
Focus on the results your decisions will get you
Time shifting can save you or drown you. If you’re going to optimize for the future, stay
focused on it, and feel good. If you’re going to optimize for the present, stay focused on the
present and feel good. If you make choices for the future, but only focus on the present, you’ll be
unhappy, and vice versa.
We want cake now, and we want to be skinny in the future. We don’t want to do our
homework now, but we want good grades. Because they are binary propositions, you can’t have
your cake and eat it too, so to speak, you always can be unhappy. If you eat your cake now, you
can mess your happiness up by thinking about fat future you. If you don’t have the cake,


focusing on fit future you, you maybe mess up the present, regretting not eating the cake. If you
want it, the unhappiness of not getting the other things on the menu, because you can only
choose one, is always there to help make you unhappy. Obviously more choices should make
you happier. Oddly enough, in the real world it doesn’t, and it’s actually scientifically proven to
make you less happy.

### The Dissatisfaction of Too Many Choices

Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies: freedom
of choice. In Schwartz’s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not
happier but more dissatisfied. More choices leads to unhappiness, partly because you can’t feel
good knowing you made the right choice, when there’s too many choices. This is also why most
sales optimized websites offer you three price points to choose from, not because they have to, or
because it even makes sense, but because you will feel better choosing one, and they will make
more sales, and happier customers.

### All Choices Have Consequences

There’s this concept of heads I win tails you lose—which is similar to the Catch 22 —which is
similar to the damned if you do damned if you don’t. Scivive is going to add a new level of
resolution on understanding to the concept. What will happen is, you’ll make a decision based on
a feeling that you have. Let’s take cheating on a diet for example. You’ll say: “It is summer” or
“I’ve had some drinks” or “It’s Friday” or “I’ve been doing good on my diet” or whatever excuse
is. Then you’ll say: “You know what, I want to treat myself and I’m going to have something
that tastes really good.” and that’s not the problem. The problem is, that you get some of the
taste, and a lot of it you swallow so quickly that your poor little tongue doesn’t even get a chance
to enjoy it.
You have to keep stuffing more in there to get the flavour. Sometimes you’re engaged in
conversation or listening to music or listening thinking about the future thinking about the past.
You’re halfway done with your dessert and you don’t even remember what it tastes like. Because
you weren’t paying attention. If you were to die after that moment, that would be a good decision
statistically. The chance that you die after that dessert is very low. Therefore you live, and live


long enough to regret that decision. What does that regret look like? How is it similar to all the
other regrets that you have for decisions that you made that were the right thing at the time, but
wasn’t the best thing for your future self?
Food is one of them. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips. Let’s say you have a lot of
money. You say, “You know what I have a lot of money and I don’t like spending it shipping. I
don’t like spending on transporting things. I don’t particularly like shipping fees. If I buy
something I might as well buy two of them to save on shipping.” Unless it’s food and it rapidly
spoils. If something doesn’t rapidly spoil and doesn’t rapidly depreciate and you can save on
shipping fees and save on the concept of adding to shopping cart and going through checkout
process and finding it again. Then you might as well buy two.
It makes total complete sense when you do it. Then future you comes along. The future you
is optimizing for a different set of outcomes. That person says “I want more space in my house
and a better version of this thing.” Now future you wants to sell the thing.
This is one example you could use food. Where you’re fat and looking at your stomach,
going: “how did we get here?” Compared to when you’re at lunch going: “You know I’m sick of
dieting, I just want to enjoy some food for once.” The right decision for one moment and the
short amount of time thereafter, is a wrong decision for another time and it is a real-life
execution of the damned if you do, damned if you don’t based on time. The level of abstraction,
the extra level of understanding that is sticking on top of this, that “damned if you do damned if
you don’t,” appears to apply to a specific slice of time, which is nearby. Whereas the
understanding that Scivive is trying to impart, is not that “you’re damned if you do damned if
you don’t,” but that you’re not damned now, you are damned then. The reason for that is because
your desire changes, your goals change.

### Time Shifting: When Do You Want Your Pain?

Now this has been explained in other words and analysing why it is that, right before you’re
about to go to sleep you dream of conquering the world and doing all of these wonderful things
that you’ve never done before. Learning a new language and learning to dance and seeing the
world and writing that novel you’ve always been meaning to write. Eating more healthily and
going to gym all that bullshit seem so easy and so nearby and so motivating when you’re about


to go to sleep. This is because you get all of the feelings of the benefits with none of the cost that
you shortly have to actually do the tasks as soon as you wake up.
Then the beginning of the new day comes and you’re not about to go to sleep, you have an
actual opportunity to do these things. The benefit seems just as real however, the cost seems so
very much larger. Because you would have to put down the croissant, grab some salad or just
enjoy the feeling of being hungry.
That time shifting in your own mind which is documented elsewhere in the book, because it
has been studied, that time shifting in your mind screws you so that whatever decision you make
that would be right in the short term, will screw you over with interest later. People have
difficulty finding a good way to overcome because there isn’t a good way to overcome it. You
either learn to time shift in your brain and try and cancel out the effects of this real-world time
shifting, so you take the world time shifting of: “I’m going to not eat this delicious food now, so
that I can have fitness later.”
You try and shift your mind to match the reality and the reality is, you’re going to try and
shift those future benefits into the present. You’re going to try and feel those future benefits in
the present. In neuro-linguistic programming they call it future pacing. That’s the best chance
you have of feeling good while depriving yourself of something that would quite easily and quite
readily bring you emotional joy.
Who doesn’t enjoy the feeling of filling up on delicious cake? The exception is people with
mental illnesses like anorexia or people that have trained themselves to deliberate action over
and over and over again to hunt something else, like fitness. They don’t have room for cake
because they’re so busy ingesting kale or whatever other horrible tasting bland foods they have
found a way to addict themselves to.
The important part of this summary is that you are (or will be) “damned if you do damned if
you don’t.” Beware of the “Catch 22” of each action. Prepare for the “the screwing you get for
the screwing you got.”
That other reference that they’ve studied involves some word like “satiation.” Whenever you
make a decision to save money now, you hurt now but gain later.

### The Grass Is Always Greener on the Other Side................................................................


By the way, the grass is always greener on the other side. The problem with the grass being
greener on the other side is, it means that no matter what side you pick when you look at the
other grass it appears greener. The funny part is that you could actually like have factual
representation physically because your perspective of the grass changes for when you’re standing
directly above it and for when you’re viewing it from the side. That also mirrors what would be
expected in reality because these plants, the whole reason they have leaves, or foliage
whatsoever, is to absorb light from the Sun. And, the Sun is always above them. Whereas you as
a human are only above, in a similar position to the Sun, that grass which is directly below you.
The saying that the grass is always greener on the other side, it may not just be a
colloquialism. It may actually have physical optical representation in the real world. This would
be interesting to study. Why would a plant spend time, whatever optical properties a plant has
from the side are very likely and predictably different from the optical properties it would have
from above. Because it gets its energy from above eighty per cent more than it gets its food from
the side.
Moral of the story: you’re going to make decisions that you regret no matter what. Because
what you optimize for in the short term is not going to be the same thing in the long term. As you
flip flop between the two, you can’t win. “I saved all this money to build a big business. But I
can’t buy back those years of decreased quality of life by not spending that money earlier; and
I’m with one girl therefore I’m not with another girl.” How do you win that one? Be with no
girls? Be with all the girls?
Order of operations - Behaviours
If you were a hippy tree hugger before your Tony Robbins event, you will be a larger one
after the event. If you were a money hungry business killing machine before, now you’re a
bigger money hungry killing machine. Same applies to meditation and money, if you adopted
meditation because you wanted to become more powerful in business, it’s likely your meditation
will bring you there.

### Loserness Momentum / Routine........................................................................................

It’s funny, if you have a weekend, life’s good and on Monday you can function well; if you
have a three-day weekend, even better, yay, more rest and relaxation. On day four though, you
become a zombie and forget how to function as a human being. Schedules shaving, showering,


these things all become optional. It’s an example of if you have a cheat day or slip a little bit,
now you’re in rolling friction instead of starting friction, and it’s easier to keep slipping, just like
locking up your brakes on a car or slipping on ice.

### Cheat Days Add Up

Diet immersion, slower loss = more risk at least.
If you go out with friends, they hold you to old lifestyle habits, and don’t count calories, and
you eat more of the tasty food because it tastes good, and you try more items because you don’t
go out that often. A single cheat day leads to more cheat days. The slower you lose your first
kilogram of fat, the more likely you are to give up before you ever build the habit that makes
continuing easy.

### Don’t Call Personal Excellence “Self-Help”

Don’t confuse personal excellence with “self-help.” Calling books on how to kick ass “self-
help” is kind of stupid, because it’s quite often that the people that read these books are far
beyond the needing of help than those that are smart enough to read this excellent and life
changing material over all of the other options on the book shelves. Who came up with that
dumb ass title? How is personal excellence in any way similar to “self-help”?
Do you even produce, bro?
Yeah, I’d better produce this book quick. Because when I have to start repeating content -
because it’s been so long since I said it, that I don’t remember whether I said it or not. I’m going
to have a lot of fucking duplicates.

### Tortured Geniuses

This one is about tortured geniuses. Isn’t it interesting that some of the most productive and
effective people in the world are tortured? Some would say that they are tortured and productive
because that productivity relieves their pain just ever so slightly. Whereas these hippie bastards
spend all their time “happy as could be,” they but don’t have to produce for happiness and thus
they don’t produce, and thus they have worse health and countries without borders being taken
over by their neighbours.


To tell you the truth that behaviour is kind of selected against. They’re going to be extinct
unless the world becomes a much friendlier place.

### Eating the Frog

Timing to do the most difficult thing first, so you can enjoy the rest of your day without it
looming over your head, is called “eating the frog.” Yes, it’s really called that.

### Repeat Positive Habits

If you feed a positive habit long enough you don’t need discipline to do it any longer. It
actually becomes harder to do the other thing that you used to do.
Reminding you to do something that you already know you should be doing, like a greatest
hits list of tasks that you should be doing, is more important than adding a new novel thing to the
long list of stuff that you don’t do.
When you’re trying to change the way you think about things, you have two options: you can
either immerse yourself or make thinking the right way so easy that it’s what you do. You wake
up, you don’t care whether you feel like it or not, you do the thing that you’re supposed to do;
it’s scheduled and you just do it. It doesn’t take will power because it’s engrained as a habit.
Don’t spend your time leeching human consciousness via games that produce nothing when
you could be solving things that matter.
I was addicted to games for a decade or so. For at least two decades I almost had a crippling
game addiction. If you are quite lucky to have achieved enough to get a lot of free time, you
know, yeah, I spent years on those games. But I got nothing out except the ability to confess how
horrible it was.
Moreover, there are teams of people who are very well paid and very intelligent; their only
goal is to make you addicted. They are paid to abuse your own psychology, to damage your
personality, to destroy themselves and the world we are living in. They may make money, but
they have sold their souls, and they may not realize it until it is too late.


## Stolen and Wasted Time.....................................................................................................

In a world of limited resources, when you assign too much energy to a particular task, the
system works less well. If you spend all your time absorbing content and not creating any, well
then, you’re not adding anything to the world. You’re just the world’s worst version of Google.
You should never spend your time checking things. If things need checking, let another
human or some mechanism like ifthisthenthat.com, IFTTT. Then let it just trigger to tell you
maybe you shouldn’t check defaults, subreddits or any Reddits whatsoever. Maybe you should
customize the Reddits.
Sports are a means to an end. The end is love and significance. It’s important to not see them
as ends. How important is our ability to put a rubber ball through a piece of metal / a basketball,
soccer ball, football. How much time should we spend on this?
If we had to go to war, and we had to win, and we had a way to consume the enemies’
population with gaming, they surely would lose that war, perhaps even before their 10th
achievement trophy.
How gross is it that teams and teams of people are sitting in rooms right now, scheming of
ways to addict the youth to basically mental death? This might be exaggerating a bit, because
games you participate in are way better than games you just watch. Participating beats the crap
out of spectating. Sadly though, the same mental triggers that have served us so well throughout
the years are stealing away from us our ability to reach the next level. The level where we don’t
become permanently extinct.
If you spend your time figuring out how to brainwash kids to grind and grind out the same
recycled garbage content, and sacrifice their life force and time to get another gem, or sword or
gun, or trophy, the world should hate you, sincerely. Can you please take your manipulation
skills and brainwashing skills and gamification skills, and go gamify the real world, so we can
survive. Many people become addicted to these products, and often regret it later in life. Even
the slave masters are slaves. How fun must it be to create ways to addict people to beat the same
boss 10 times? These games steal your soul even while you sleep. Your dreams are consumed by
the grind.
There was a pretty interesting interview with some suit working at Nestle, and the
interviewer asked, “You guys focus on selling healthy foods, and you sell chocolate, is the


chocolate healthy?” The guy responded in a pretty genius way. He said, “There are no unhealthy
foods, only unhealthy diets.” That’s actually legit.
It’s probably true for games as well, some gameplay is probably great for the same reason it’s
great in the wild. There’s just some things that cross the line, and when you aim for crushing
addiction and hours stolen as your goal, you’re hurting the users. Go steal someone else’s life.
When you see a movie, it has an end. When you play an MMORPG, the content creators own
your soul.
It’s not just MMORGs, its NASCAR, the NFL, you name it, they want your hours, and more
importantly they want your money. South Park had a great episode on it, making money on the
backs of the addicted. You should watch it.
Here’s the situation we’re in as human beings, one could focus on oneself and loved ones,
and on survival, in which case one may need lots of people to get their act together. If we change
our goals, and we stop caring about ourselves in the present, and begin to care only about those
that come long after us, then we can shift our focus to becoming multi-planetary. Of course, the
only way that pays off is when one of our planets gets destroyed, otherwise, the insurance policy
never really paid for itself.
Some would much rather bet the whole farm on this one egg basket not blowing up, then they
might get to survive without rolling the dice of deciding to move to Mars or not, and watching
one of the other planets fail. Who are you kidding? It is more likely that you are going to die of
some boring stuff, being complacent, a lifelong collection of should of and could of, culminating
in a whimper, not a bang.
Or we could fight, and take our destiny into our hands. We need only unplug our bad habits
from our hands and put them to good work on the world around us. Wash them first.

### The Time Sink of the Other Sex

You rarely hear about great men being womanizers or great dancers as well, for greatness
tends to require a fair amount of time to cultivate and outcompete your fellow woman, and so it’s
very likely that if you want to be greater than other people on the thing, you’ll need to put in
more focus and more time at the sacrifice of other things that they will have time for, because
they haven’t made the same sacrifices. Luckily the world is so lazy compared to what’s possible
that you don’t really have to make that many sacrifices in the grand scheme of things, because


you can get quite a lot done in the time that everyone else is literally messing around and doing
things they barely even enjoy.
Beware however that the other reason that you don’t see a lot of great men being great at
more than a single thing is because it’s also just a function of your filter; even if the other thing
that you ere selecting for wasn’t great at all, and it was just say, being six feet tall, or having
green eyes, you’d still knock out a lot of candidates just with that rather non great selector.
Being a good womanizer is very time consuming. You will spend your days hunting, and
scheming, and dating, and gaming, and “making love,” and in the end, you’re very likely to get
the same results out of it that most other men have. They in general don’t become rich, nor
powerful, for making women want to have sex with you one by one is more of a sales thing, and
less of a product development thing.

### Success/Failure Cycle Timing

Every time you go out and don’t pull (take a woman home or get her number), you have a real
cost, and unless you have much better than average state management, you will be riding a
difficult cycle. Scivive suggests only going out to pull if you can continue to do that long enough
to get a win and ride it. If you have a win, and then go cancel it out by getting a loss and riding
the loss, you’re likely to focus and feel the more recent event over the better farther away one.
This applies to games, and love, and all other matters of, rage if you lose, joy if you win; we
have emotional momentum as humans.

### The Pareto Principle

The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of
factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80 per cent of the results come from 20 per
cent of the causes or effort. This means that the next 20 per cent of results will require 80 per
cent of the effort.
Car detailers live far outside the Pareto 80 / 20 effectiveness principle. That’s why no matter
where you go in your life you could stare at a thing and make it ever so incrementally better all
day long and unless that scales to other people, if it’s only for you only for a single other person,
you’re probably wasting your time.


### Diminishing Returns

Being a jack a jack of all trades is better than going deeper into a single skill, because going to
deeper on a skill just gets you incremental returns. Whereas, it’s binary if you’re missing
components to get your business complete, you’re not yet doing business. But if you can perform
moderately at bit of all the components done, then you are in business. Then you can
incrementally improve.
You can’t really improve what doesn’t exist. Therefore being a jack of all trades and
entrepreneurship needs to come before deep diving into improvement. I think that’s the same
reason that hoarding exists. You need all of the things more than you need more of a single thing.
That’s like the concept behind essential multi-vitamins. You don’t need more, you need just that
one.

### Skill Momentum Turning Cost

If you are a complete neophyte at something, it costs you quite literally nothing to learn one
better format over a different, perhaps more common, but worse format. For example QWERTY
versus DVORAK typing. However, if you are extremely proficient at the QWERTY keyboard
format, then you will incur a gigantic up front cost to switching, that the new person doesn’t.
Thus Experts pay a much higher cost to change course than noobs. You could call this skill
momentum.

### Time Spent Recovering

Another reason endurance sports are tough is because not only do they take longer, they take
longer to recover to from too, and then you’re really tired as well. You may feel really sore, so
you not only lose the time it takes going and flopping about, you also lose the time going and
driving to where these faraway places that you can flop about in for a very long time, and then
recovering, and then being sore, and then going to sleep earlier.

### Avoid the Common Mistakes

```
Don’t sweat the small stuff, by knowing what the big stuff is.
```

One mistake people make is not noticing that they’re chasing a small percentage difference
that doesn’t matter. Another common mistake is mistaking linear changes in a number for
importance, when that change is a small percentage. What really is the difference between being
able to type 115 and 119 words per minutes? And how many hours of testing and practice eat
into whatever useful gain could be had? The time one may have spent overclocking and typing
faster will never be recovered in actuality, one may forever be cash negative on the endeavors. It
is an insurance policy that you can buy very expensively in your “free” time. That would pay in
the event that for reasons outside your control something needed to be done very rapidly, and
due to your low ROI, spending many hours making things faster, you could win back some of
the time through the increased speed. It’s like being in a race, and trying to do some pushups real
quick at the start so you could try and run faster. You would just be losing ground without much,
if any, benefit.
The time for practice and warm up exercises is before the race. Bad analogy, the idea is, if
you slow yourself down trying to go faster, it can actually be a net loss.
You might want to stick with the computer you have for as long as possible, and as far as
typing goes, don’t be surprised if Google and their Al team has speech recognition entirely
solved for English speakers in the not so distant future. In this way, technology advancement
could make all your hours of typing practice completely wasted.

### Being Great at the Wrong Things

I used to own a car stereo store, we would make peoples cars as loud as possible, particularly
in the bass area. Now when you are younger you don’t have quite the same empathy or
knowledge of what other people are thinking about you, or how you may be affecting other
people’s lives. Such was the case with the very loud vehicles I drove around.
Get this, amongst people that are into the car stereo scene, there’s actually something called a
SPL contest, or dB drag racing. Basically you armour your car, turn it into a giant concrete box,
and fill it with speakers that are only great at playing a single frequency (which is basically the
opposite of music). Then you try to hit that tone, and usually break much of the speakers and car
and amplifiers during the process. Also you most likely drove that car to the show on a trailer,
because it was far too dangerous and unreliable and slow to drive of its own volition.


Equally as stupid as incentivizing the destruction of cars into science projects to make noise
in very short bursts. I’d say drag racing and fast cars are just about as stupid. The death tolls are
gigantic, and once again I’m guilty of playing into that stereotype of boy racer as well. I wonder
if I’m executing any bad ideas disguised as good ideas right now. Come to think of it, if you look
at all the things on the magazine stand in your local book store or supermarket, I think you will
find that we humans have all kinds of inane and backwards hobbies.

### Hoarding

How about the irrational hoarding of things? If you are artful enough with it, you don’t look
like a generic “keep all things” hoarder, but to some degree you are fulfilling the same driving
impetus. You could call it a sport to find all the stupid things you’re doing that don’t fit with
what you’d say a fulfilling and rewarding life for you would look like.
It’s also funny how these things change massively with age. You don’t see a lot of young kids
worry about politics, and you don’t see a lot of 40 year old people worrying about doing BMX
tricks on their bicycle.
Some stupid things stay for the long haul, some go away, and some come anew. If you
haven’t really thought about gardening too much, but could imagine that if there was some time
of break in the normal food distribution systems, you would dearly wish that your roses were
perhaps more edible and more the size of say, pumpkins. Not very many young people that are
into gardening.

### Not Many Hours in a Day!

If you want to know how important transition time is, you basically have 16 hours left in a
day after you have sleep; and that doesn’t include the transition from waking up, brushing your
teeth, eating, talking to people, putting on clothes, taking off clothes, and driving to and from
work. So basically if you want to know how important it is to cue out transition time out of your
life, just assume that you had to spend all of your time in transition, so what if your time to and
from work, walking or driving that’s all you ever did you slept (pulled over to the side of the
road). That would be an unfulfilling life, you wouldn’t enjoy it, and so it’s very likely that


cutting that out in its entirety would add great value to your life. Meanwhile many people still
commute, on average, 45 minutes to 1 hour each way to their jobs.
Life is made of time. If you spend 25% of your working hours of a day doing something
which disappears the moment you go to sleep, it literally dies the moment you lay your head to
bed. Man, you are recreating the same work over and over and over and over and over and over
again, and it doesn’t stack, it doesn’t build, it doesn’t scale. You wouldn’t even need to do it if
everyone else would be willing to lower the arms race.

### Cutting Out Transition Time

It’s way easier to do some squats in your living room than it is to get dressed, then go to the
gym, then do squats there, then shower, then return home, and now you are back where you
could have been with 1 hour less spent. Actually an hour or more, why waste the hour of your
life? Are you actually hitting on people at the gym? If you’re not, why would you go there?
Perhaps you like sports, and that takes more people. In that case, or in any case where the hour
spent commuting and such provides any real additional benefit to you, then it could be cool.
Sadly, it’s hard to have a squash court in your building.

### Playing the Odds With Life

How much time have you wasted in the past 10 to 12 years of your life, doing things that you
can’t even remember doing now? Some of those years may have been wasted during what is
supposed to be the best years of your life, which maximizes the penalty. That’s why it’s so
important that you do things that checkpoint in your mind, you must do things that have lasting
value and impact, if not for the world, at least yourself, because one day you’ll wake up and ask
yourself, “where did my life go?” Dickens process.
That’s a time frame issue, it’s very likely that everything we do is likely to fail. It is very
likely that you are going to meet the same fate as everyone that came before you, therefore you
must play the odds. Are you on a calorie restricted diet starving yourself? Not if you love food. Is
that going to make you die earlier? Yes, very likely.
How can you do that? Well you’re playing the odds that this live forever idea doesn’t work
out anyway, and so you’ve got to get the quality while you are here, so you maybe walk a fine


line between enjoyment and savings. You walk a fine line between spending and savings,
between working out and taking a break, and maybe having a drink. And if you don’t work that
fine line and you don’t perform that balance you’re very likely to end up in pain, because a lack
of balance is the definition of pain.

# TIME

## Prioritize

Don’t make perfect the enemy of the good. Iterate. Fake it till you make it. Do what’s important
first, and get the basics done. Only if you have time should you then worry about reaching
perfection.
Urgent isn’t always important.
What can you do that has lasting value? What can you do to reward and punish yourself so
that your life has the emotions you want, and the destiny you desire?

### Stack the Deck

How can you set up the game to win? If you don’t set up the game in a way you can win, you
will never win.
Know your outcome, and know it very specifically. If you don’t know exactly what you want,
you may never notice that you’ve already achieved it, and thus steal from yourself the glory and
good feelings you deserve.
Realize when you’ve won the game and celebrate!
The stair climbing strategy of want, get, be satisfied, want different, get, be satisfied, over and
over is the most effective that exists. You’re not supposed to be in any one of those three states
too long, you’re supposed to cycle through them. As a living person, it’s not normal or desirable
to be totally still, neither in emotion or location. To be human is to experience not just the storms
and calms of Mother Nature, but of our own passions.

### Directional Tactics and Scope


You eat cheeseburgers in a single direction. You don’t eat a circle around the outside, or at
least you shouldn’t. Thus, when you are working, feel free to get started, and just iterate and go a
single direction. Don’t worry about understanding everything up front, you’ll understand it better
once you’ve started. If there is work that has to be done no matter what, go ahead and do it,
instead of sitting in analysis paralysis.
Do that of which others only dream.

### Don’t Be Distracted by Trying to Remove Distractions.......................................................

Having tunnel vision is more efficient than removing distractions.
Tunnel vision is discipline, changing your environment is “motivation.”
Another strategy you’ll see of people trying to break through the barriers to getting hard work
done is they’ll try to minimize all the distractions. Sure, you could do that, but you are falling for
the Meta of controlling what isn’t the work. If you saved the time you would have spent doing
that, and just forced the discipline of doing the work, then you would win twofold. Once from
actually doing the work, and once again from not wasting time “minimizing distractions.” You’ll
find that if you maximize whatever screen you are working on, it’s already done all the
distraction minimization for you! All you see is that window. Maximize and go!
Imagine you are back in the Stone Age, and you are hunting for your dinner. You spot the
prey in the jungle. Meanwhile, you are surrounded by “distractions”—other animals, the wind,
the mosquitoes biting you, the tiger lurking nearby. Can you eliminate these distractions? Of
course not! They will never go away. To kill your prey—and put food in your stomach—you
must ignore the distractions and focus on your task.
Now think abut your office. Phones ringing, people talking, your boss interrupting. You
cannot remove these distractions. Learn to ignore them and power through your day.

### Combine What You Need to Do With What You Want to Do

If you want an excuse to write your book, perhaps try out that new keyboard you’ve bought,
or a new key layout, or new hotkeys, perhaps a custom programmed keyboard layer. The trick
here, is that, if you get used to testing your new setup while you are doing something productive;


you will get progress in both the productive thing, in this case book writing, and in the other,
experiment for fun thing.
You can see this example in other places like trying your new headphones out on a jog, or
testing your new running shoes whilst running.
Now, where is the pitfall here? Well, if you get used to testing the new cool things in the
wrong, useless place, you will get more addicted to doing the wrong thing, and it will leech away
the time you would have had to do those things that you know you really should be doing.
Make your fulfilment fun. Picking some cool or fun things around what it is that you know
you should be doing is great, if and only if you can make sure you use and have fun with the cool
things only when you’re doing the productive thing that you’re trying to make more fun, to
produce a good habit. Don’t spend 100 hours doing typing tests of random words fed to you. Do
spend 100 hours expressing yourself using your own words. Only one of the two has lasting
value.
If you’re lucky, the two things you’re playing with might even amplify each other. For
instance, if you wanted to practice your singing, and you wanted to learn a new language, great!
Now you can practice singing a song in a new language!

### Hobbies Steal Your Time

You only have so much attention, so be careful what hobbies you have and how many, for at
some point they control you more than you control them.
It’s amazing how few hobbies you can really have. They’re extremely time consuming. Every
single little thing you want to do that you don’t think takes a lot of time, “Oh I’ll just lift some
weights” “I’ll just, you know check some sports” - takes twenty, thirty per cent of our useful
hours in a day. You only get to do about five of those until you’re out of time. You then become
a product of your hobbies and enslaved by them.
If you look at the Wikipedia on hobbies, you’ll see that there’s not actually too many of them.
There’s less than 300, that’s pretty damn surprising to me. The next time you’re bored, you’ve
got a great excuse, there’s only 300 things to fool around with. Just kidding, there’s a fair amount
of depth to many of them.


#### Social Media Steals Time, Too

### It’s Difficult to Be Objective About Yourself

If you’re a good measurer, whatever you measure, it’s true. It’s easier to get truth out of the
real world, measurement-wise. Some other truths are much harder to come to when you have to
do more than measure, like predict or see something without measuring points like that.
There are a lot of times when the worst person to measure whether you are performing well,
acting well, or have good posture, saying the right words, or lifting a weight the right way is you.
This is because you are busy doing the thing and being reactionary, responding to your
subconscious impetus to do the thing.
On the contrary, the people around you have more processing power to observe what you are
doing with your body, which you’re not focused on, what you’re doing with your voice, what
you’re focusing on that is to the exclusion of other things. It’s actually possible that someone
else could see you doing something before you’re aware of the concept that you’re doing it.
It doesn’t just apply to martial arts or lifting weights, it applies to facial expression. If
someone else looks at you and can tell you don’t like a thing, you may not realize that you do not
like the thing, because it’s outside your focus. You’re focused on the thing and he’s focused on
you. You could respond to people’s internal state quicker than they can, and be aware of it
quicker than they can, because they’re busy doing it and your busy watching it. There’s a trick
where if someone’s going to slight you, you can preemptively slight them, or perform an activity
which punishes their bad behaviour, but do it so quickly that you don’t seem petty, or slight, and
just seems like the natural course of events.
Your personal attributes compound against each other so if you’ve got a really strong position
in one area, you’re already in diminishing returns on it. You should work on the other areas that


would multiply against it. So if you’ve only got three traits, let’s say they’re looks, money and
leads, then you’d work to improve the ones you don’t already have.
When people say that you should dress to impress and dress for a job, it’s not the dressing
that matters. It’s other people’s perception of your usefulness. So, dressing is one part of that.
Posture is one part of that. Knowledge is a part of that. Focus, are you self-centered?
Do you care about them? Do you work well in teams? It’s not just dress for success, it’s be
obviously useful.
Forget dressing for success, like dress for usefulness. Success looks different in different
environments. You wouldn’t want to wear a business suit scuba diving, one would assume. If
you want to save money, you should be taking your extra downtime and using it to research
getting a lower cost and buying larger quantities on places like eBay or Alibaba because it is
unlikely that you’ll find a better deal on almost anything than those places.

### Trying Drugs? Do Your Research

If you must try drugs, try to do it after you do all the other cool, bad ass things. And if you
must try drugs, realize they are dangerous. Get the testing kits, do a lot of research, be very
careful. Don’t take anyone’s word for anything. Have all the safeties in place. Don’t plan on
driving. Plan for it to go bad, plan for your heart to stop. Why wouldn’t you? You only have one
heart.
So, do your research. Plan it. Do it right, or be someone that’s happy living this life where
you only get to feel what you earn to feel through directed focus. Maybe it is meditation, maybe
it is yoga, maybe it is deprivation tanks, and maybe it’s just having a really positive outlook. You
can feel all the great feelings of life without needing to do the superhuman feats.

### Take Care of Yourself First

If you’re ever curious why you shouldn’t sacrifice all of your time and life energy for a giant
mega corporation, think about dividing up what you are across all the people of the world. Give
everyone a penny. How much money do you have? Or more interestingly, everyone needs to eat,
so you give a little piece of your body to everybody and see how many people you can feed.


What you discover is that if you want to live properly in this world, you need to be a little
greedy.

### Not Everyone Seeks a Solution to Their Problem!

There exists an iteration that women enjoy building problems, thinking about things and
associating with them and making great narratives about whatever problem that they have going
on. When they bring that thing to you and show it to you, they don’t want you to destroy it with
your simple, logical, easy, solution because that’s to disrespect all the work they put into
understanding such a fine and beautiful problem that they’re very desperately trying to convince
you is insolvable and therefore gigantic. They want to take small problems and make them large,
and if you take a large problem and make it small, you’re an asshole. You just destroyed a lot of
work they did. You just made it less important, and they spent all day making it more important.
Really make sure that it’s one of the one out of fifty times that your female companion
actually wants you to solve something before you go and destroy the excellent problem that she
helped create.

### Important Tips to Remember

- If you’re not using a paper and pen and taking advantage of the fact that the worst paper and
pen is better than the best memory, you’re doing harm to yourself and your friends and your
loved ones. You’re making their subconscious work against them.
- Don’t discount the power of repetition. In addition, don’t discount, in a lot of areas, the
necessity of repetition. In other areas, still, you might not have to pull your punches. Your
hardest punch might not be enough.
- No one else has the privilege of seeing how you can destroy people by being overly nice,
because you have had to have worked hard enough and saved hard enough to be able to be overly
nice to another person. You don’t get to see the destructive effects unless you’ve experimented in
the world of doing something most people can’t, which is providing, financially, too much for
another person.
- Couples who don’t have prenuptial agreements, they get divorces. The reason is if you give
someone a million dollar reward for thinking you’re not funny or cool to hang out with anymore,


let me tell you, for a million dollars it’s very easy for people to fall out of love with you. For a
million dollars, it’s very easy for people to think that you’re just not that cool anymore. You
could be the funniest guy in the world and if there’s a million dollars payoff for not laughing at
your jokes, that million dollars is going to get paid. Don’t structure the underlying agreements
and mutual beliefs in a way where the parties have a reason to break it. If you’re married, you
and your wife having a join account makes a good bank history.

- You hear these stories about terrible things happening to people and no one even called 911
because they felt someone else was going to do it. You learn the way to overcome that is to look
at a single person and point directly at them and say, “You. You call 911 now. You.” And make
sure that they understand.
- People need to learn the contraindications for their suggestions, particularly the medical
ones, because they’re a very small set. In the unlikely chance that anyone accepts the advice it’ll
prevent great harm from the people accepting it.
- It’s important to know that there are some principles which apply all over the place which
are the great awesome things, that’s like learning how to duck a punch. You don’t have to be a
really smart guy to duck a punch, you just have to practice. You don’t have to be a really smart
guy to throw a punch, you just have to practice it. What was being taught earlier about things that
can be taught and things that can’t be taught, this is one of the great revelations that will make
you smarter, make you more powerful, make you more effective that can be taught, so let’s learn
it.
- Timing is important. If you go to get your eyes checked, it’s best to go with your eyes
already tired, already under strain, because those are the times when you will need your glasses
the most. Therefore, it’s better to go there with your eyes under that condition when you do the
testing, so that the prescription that you get is there when you need it the most. Now, would a
normal person know that there was a better and worse time to get their eye test? No, it’s not easy
to know. Would a person know that when you get your prescription made that there’s actually a
level of tolerance at the lab that makes your glasses, and some labs have higher tolerance than
others?
For instance, if you have astigmatism that needs to be corrected by a certain number of
degrees, then some labs are okay with five degrees, some are okay with two, some are okay with
seven and the person writing the prescription is actually able to write on the prescription that no


tolerances are allowed. You wouldn’t normally know those details. You would just assume that
when these glasses came out of the glass factory that they were properly created. These types of
assumptions about timing and quality exist all over the place and people are just starting to
become aware of them.

- People thought that what you ate was super important and then they realized that there’s
micro world of amazing bacteria in people’s guts and that they’re mildly different. What might
be a great diet for you isn’t for someone else, not only because they’re biologically different, but
because of this other species of microbes that has nothing to do with their DNA, they have their
own DNA. All the bacteria and little things that live in your stomach operate differently from
human to human. What lives in your stomach is so important that koalas actually eat their mom’s
excrement, it’s called Pap; in order to colonize their guts with the bacteria that they need to
digest what is primarily their food source almost exclusively their primary nutrient source,
eucalyptus leaves.

### Organize Your Stuff

Put your food in the fridge oldest to the front, newest to the rear, so that when you use them in
that order it makes some sense. Same with your clothes, when you’re done washing your clothes,
put your clean clothes on the very back so that you use the ones that haven’t been used yet.
Otherwise you short cycle and the small group that is in the front gets used and then washed and
will just keep getting cycled and cycled quicker. Then they’ll fade or get too small and you won’t
be able to use them anymore. It’s better to cycle everything evenly.
Shortcuts to organizing things in your house could include using the same organization
system from the store that you bought it from, because they already put the effort in putting
things in the categories. You benefitted from the categorization when you bought it, so you can
use the same categorization in your home to find it.
Travel checklists are pretty useful.
If you’re looking for an obviously easy way to improve your life, take a look through your
Internet search history, see if there’s any particular type of pretty people that you look at more
than others on the Internet. Maybe they’re naked, maybe they’re in bikinis, maybe they’re just
smiling, and move to wherever those people come from, wherever they’re most numerous. Then


you’ll be naturally triggered to be happier and getting it the natural way can’t be any worse than
paying for a bill for brainwashing yourself.

### Goal Setting and Achieving

If you aren’t specific about what you want, then you’re not able to make those decisions
where they can be made.
If you get an A in the class that you don’t care about, then you’re going to see your worst on
the things you did care about, but didn’t have time for.
The people that have, through dedicated habit, luck, or curiosity, or chemical intervention that
can stay engaged with a task for longer, they’re able to reap the profit from having skill that
takes many hours to develop, remember and execute.

#### Intermittent and faster rewards enhance task engagement

It would be useful for people to see personal development as rewarding in the short term to
enhance repetitive and short term achievement, so that people don’t have to bridge these vacuous
gaps of friction. It would be even better that they stay in the rolling friction of constant,
intermittent rewards, but shorter, smaller term rewards would be the next best strategy. Thus, if
you know that when you go to the gym you are actually getting laid (by proxy of a future time),
and that’s what triggers in your brain, or if you know that when you are working hard, making
money, you are actually getting laid, then that’s just one more reason to do the right thing, and
overcome the easy wrong thing that’s always there nagging you to choose it to your own
detriment.
Maybe someone should solve the reward problem. Maybe if you gamified book writing and
have a voting system and a peer group that rewards you for work well done, and then you pay
into the system by reviewing other people’s feats the same way they’re reviewing yours, maybe
you’d have a self-reinforcing cluster of people circle-jerking each other into greatness. Isn’t that
what teams are? Isn’t that what clubs are? Pretty sure that’s what they are. Pretty sure there’s
people circle jerking each other to get excellence and performance out of their lives.

### Time


Make all your clocks and watches accurate to National Institutes of Standards and Technology
(NIST) time. Why not?
Use alarms, now you don’t have to be worried about missing a thing, let your phone worry for
you. Use calendars with alarms, now you don’t have to miss people’s birthdays or forget to get
your teeth cleaned.

### Cheating

Here’s a scene from The Simpsons:
Mr. Burns: Tell me, Simpson. If an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you
wouldn’t be averse to taking it, would you?
Homer: Uhh, not as such.
Mr. Burns: Neither would I. I’ve always felt that there’s far too much hysteria these days
about so-called cheating. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it’s your duty as
an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the jumble to the quick-
witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say
cheating is the gift man gives himself!
Homer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat.
Mr. Burns: Excellent.

### Learning Takes Time You Could Spend Taking Action

Get off your ass and do something. Stop learning. All of these chapters of awesomeness mean
nothing if left unacted upon.
The world doesn’t need to learn more. The knowledge is all free; free to deliver, free to
receive, and free to put into use. It’s never been better, it’s never been more plentiful. We don’t
need more knowledge, we need people to get off their ass and do things, and that’s what sales
people do, more so than anyone else in the world. They get you to sign on the dotted line and to


use your economic resources to better your own life, and then you got to do something for
somebody else.
General success, gratitude, relationships, peer group, internal environment, fairness to one’s
self
The pain of working goes away when you start the work. Getting to the gym is hard, being at
the gym is easy. You can’t live at the gym forever, or at work forever, which is great. You don’t
need to, and you shouldn’t, but you should develop have a healthy duty cycle.

### The Negative Space of Getting Things Done

If you picked your top 25 things and took off the bottom 20 and avoided them, because they
might hurt the top 5, you would be using the negative space idea. The result is more work on the
stuff you really care about. Depending on how far different your 1-25 really were, you might
have a top 10 that were almost all the same thing, so there’s a little bit of accuracy of scope that
is involved.
You know how there’s a momentum thing to working out, once you get the ball rolling
towards going to the gym, once you’re there it’s very easy to just work out, well the same thing
applies to developing bad habits. If you start becoming lazy, or missing a workout, or eating
unhealthy food, then it’s really easy to keep that ball rolling as well.
Thus as important as it is to show that you should get the ball rolling in the right direction,
it’s almost as important to make sure that you don’t get the ball rolling in the wrong direction.
Avoid everything you “kind of” want to do.
The “avoid at all cost” idea states that if you list your top 25 things you want to do, pick 5
and avoid at all cost the other 20. Your engagement of the 20 ideas will make it more likely you
don’t achieve the top 5. Scivive doesn’t agree with this, because the 6th idea could actually be on
the path of 1-5. However, the fact that you only have space for a couple hobbies, and really only
have enough time to personally work on a couple of things professionally, is evidenced by
another quote attributed to Warren Buffett:
“The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful
people say no to almost everything.”
A different approach to getting things done is called the negative space idea. If you picked
your top 25 things and took off the bottom 20 and avoided them, because they might hurt the top


5, (which is the direct opposite from avoid at all cost idea above) you would be using the
negative space idea. The result is more work on the stuff you really care about. Depending on
how far different your 1-25 really were, you might have a top 10 that were almost all the same
thing, so there’s a little bit of accuracy of scope that is involved.
How to use this: Start your day with what is first on your list and work your way down.
Avoid at all costs the following; time sinks, and the general wasting of pointless effort that
have stolen the most hours of your life. Those hours aren’t coming back.
Steve Martin also quotes the ascetic style of focusing on only one thing! Never mind all the
other shiny distractions so other comics got taken away with.

### Getting Stuff Done............................................................................................................

You can skip motivational stuff by just getting your significance from the hard stuff you’re
doing. The reason it’s easier to argue with people on the internet than it is to write a book, is
because you get a feeling of winning nearly instantly when you crush trolls on the internet, but
you don’t really get any positive significance feedback in a reasonable time frame on text that
you write for a book.
Thus when you want to get things done, you can either work building motivation, or you can
work doing the actual hard things that you’d hoped that the motivation would get you to want to
do. You make it easier to do the hard stuff when you create a short term reward where your
psyche feels good doing the hard stuff, because you feel important having done it. If you can
manage this without involving third parties, that’s even better.

### Focus

Distractions eat time and create problems.
Most books are written by people in their 30s, because if you’re 20, you’re too inexperienced
to know anything to write about. If you’re 40, you may not care to write about it anymore. If you
only have a couple of good ideas, it’s a lot easier to get started and feel good about what you’re
doing than if you have tons of good ideas. Knowing too much, or being too old, or being too
smart, can all get in the way of being productive. Possessing any of those qualities makes it


harder for you to focus on a single thing till completion, because there’s more and more side
interests and things that get in the way, like a house, or a family, or your hobbies, or your yacht.
There is no better way to start your day than by growing your strength and willpower. The
feeling of accomplishment makes all the tasks of the day so much easier.

### It Begins With Desire

Let’s be serious. If reading a book on how to get rich actually worked for people, well by
golly, you’d know a lot more rich people. Knowledge is only as useful as its application.
The first step to getting things done is actually wanting things. When you want things badly
enough, that you must have them, then you might schedule them. If you schedule things, you
might do them. If you do them, you might get what you thought you would get, and thus get
what you wanted.
The first step to scheduling is the desire. The why and the urgency. Why must you have it
now? If you solve the why, everything will pretty much work on autopilot. It’s just like habits.
You only have to work to build a habit about three weeks until it sticks, then its autopilot, you
just do it without thinking. It’s free and awesome once you’re three weeks in. If you want
something urgently enough, you’ll find a way.
Don’t watch, do! Life isn’t a spectator sport, get in the game.
“You can’t call failing to do the important thing ‘multitasking’” - Richard on June 2nd, 2016

### Start the Day a Winner With Willpower

Wake up 7am, bathroom/weigh yourself, walk to your home gym, Chin-ups, Bench, Deadlift,
overhead press, breakfast, shower, floss, brush teeth, scrape tongue. Now do the thing you’re
most likely to put off, first. Just as you exercised your body, you shall exercise your willpower.
What are the strengths of this schedule? You put in slightly better reps on chin-ups because
you’re one breakfast and one bathroom trip lighter. You alternated pushing and pulling
movements and ordered the exercises by muscle group. You worked on external attractiveness.
You showered after working out while combining teeth maintenance, shaving, hair care,
deodorant, perfume.
Performing hard tasks improves will power, just like lifting heavy weights improves muscles.


Willpower gets stronger with training, just like your muscles. You might not be surprised to
hear that perhaps willpower could be grown in different ways just like muscles can be grown
differently. There might be something akin to fast-twitch and slow-twitch will power. Just like
you should exercise your body every day, you should exercise your will every day as well.
Drive, the feeling that makes you do.
Upgrade your “shoulds” to “musts.”
The more things you upgrade from “shoulds” to “musts” the more you’ll actually schedule,
and then do, and then get.
Get a coach or a partner or a team
You’ll do more to maintain your positive relationship with them than you will for yourself.

### Don’t Waste a Minute

Free up your time by not wasting it (Don’t do wrong things)
Waste not a minute, for minutes are what life is made of. Time is the great equalizer of men.
We all have only 24 hours in a day. Use this to outcompete everyone else. While they’re
watching the game on television, you can be catching the winning pass and making love to the
homecoming queen/king.
Most people waste tons of time every day. Since you’re reading this book, you might not be
“most” people, compare yourself to the average American:

Replace time wasting with time honoring
Take everything you do that upon analysis doesn’t actually lead to any tangible benefits to
your life, and just replace them, and do it for three weeks so it sticks. If you cut out browsing
Facebook, or really idly browsing anything you choose, what could you use that time for?
Learning a new language? Finding love? Creating something beautiful?


The sky isn’t the limit! You can built a weather balloon and send a miniature camera into
space, past our sky. Use GPS to find it when it comes back down and view the photos of earth
from the stratosphere.

### Use Your Jealousy!

Jealousy exists to motivate you to act in the right directions! If you don’t have juicy things
you want at first glance, then notice what you’re jealous of, and try getting those things. If you
are still having trouble finding something juicy to replace your time sinks with, then just pick
something other people enjoy, and try it for a few weeks to see if you’d learn to enjoy it to.
Anything is better than the same dead ends you’re already an expert at.

### Identify the Waste

Are you really good at the wrong things? That’s worse not better. Makes you like the wrong
things more than you should. If you have a lot of “achievement badges” in a video game, you
could say that’s a counter achievement anywhere outside that game.
Pooping
Eat less
Drink less alcohol, take less pain killers
Squatty potty
Combine your pooping with other tasks you already would be doing in near the toilet. Drop a
piece of toilet paper in the bowl first so you don’t splash your butt with water. Pee sitting down if
standing up is making a mess
Learning things you don’t use
Honour your time Highest and best (do right things)
Be efficient Do the right things the right way
Don’t fix what isn’t broken (time sinks)
Respect how hard things really are (complexity)
Before you think of changing the motor in your car, think about how often other people do
that. Want to be the first person on the block to have or do XYZ experimental new thing? Be
prepared to see it blow up in your face, perhaps literally. Someone once tried silencing a coffee


machine with Dynamat, didn’t work. Another person tried sanding their keyboards’ keycaps with
a Dremel to make them smoother, boy did the surfaces melt fast. If you want greatness you have
to experiment, just respect complexity while you do. The more complicated your idea, the more
and more likely it will not only never happen, but mess you up the whole way.
Use proven solutions, don’t experiment.
Being on the cutting edge makes you bleed. First adopters are how you discover what needs to
be fixed. Whenever you can, massively favour as many parts in your master plan as you can that
are already known to work together. When you do hit a problem, and you surely will, you are
absolutely going to love all the free tech support and innovative solutions that all the poor souls
that were there before you had to discover and create, and luckily tell the world about. Ask
anyone that has been modifying a “project car” of theirs for years and years, the progress is slow
as hell and often seems to be going backwards. The car seems to get more disassembled instead
of assembled. That looks like, and often is, the opposite of progress. If you’re looking for a
competitive advantage, or want to do something never before done though, you might just have
to bite the experiment bullet.

## Drive

Focus on a future that is yours and not somebody else’s
What the far future looks like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future)
You shouldn’t care. You have to earn being around long enough to meet those challenges.
Futurists, and transhumanists are largely guilty of focusing on problems that will never be theirs.
Stay in the game. Remain relevant.
Autobiographers often have time to be as such, because they stopped being important.
Autobiographies are created when you write about what things were like back when you used
to matter, using all the free time you have, because you don’t matter anymore. Maybe some are
instead ghost written and thus don’t actually take much time out of their days.
See how valuable your time is
Don’t be a degenerate gambler with your time.


So many of us look down on those with crippling addictions. A man who just can’t stop
losing money gambling, taking the same bad deals over and over again. Well, don’t feel too
superior. As that man gambles with money, it’s likely you do the same with your time. Doing the
same things over and over again that never pay off, yet you just can’t stop doing them. It’s easy
to see that man’s bank account is empty, it’s not as easy to see how you’ve wasted away so much
of your precious time.

### Choosing What to Do (Pathing)

Copy what works.
Model great behaviour that gets great results.
Many of the concepts Scivive developed regarding influence were just by looking at the
patterns used to generate influence successfully, like giving positive and negative reasons to do a
thing to help the person feel it. Maybe they respond better to fear, maybe greed, maybe they just
like more reasons to do a thing. It’s by analysing what worked that a name was created for it, and
now that you can see the framework, you can translate it into different behaviours. Negative
space is used in art, let’s notice where it’s used in influence as well.

### Learn to Hate Boredom

Turn procrastination against itself.
People don’t like doing things that suck. If what you need to do seems like it sucks to you,
and you might be right, then there are some tricks you can use to make the dreariness of doing
what you must seem far less. If you can sit in front of what you must do, and not do it, but not do
anything else either. Use the inaction, the boredom of just sitting there in front of your work.
Amplify the pain.
You may not yet have the willpower to do what you must, but you might have the willpower
to not do all the other distractions, and bullshit that takes your mind off the fact that you are not
doing what you must. Then it will be just you, and your work, sitting there, looking at each other.
You will be fidgeting and in pain, for the boredom should be pretty intense as you sit there
without diversion, just you and your work, and the thought that you are sitting there, not doing it.


What we’re doing here is creating a lever by which you can create a new greater suck, far
larger than the suck of just doing what you have to. The suck of boredom, and living in the state
of knowing you’re not doing what you should, is far greater, and becomes far greater with time,
than the suck of just doing what you need to do.
No music, no fidgeting, on reading, no dreaming, no browsing the web, no chatting, just you
and the terrible boredom. The more unpleasant you can make it, the more likely you are to get to
work. Make work the path of least resistance.
We use that desire to not do things which are boring, to create a greater suck of boredom and
discomfort that makes our original suck of doing our work seem so small in comparison. We use
our own bad habits against themselves. To avoid the pain of boredom, we’ll do even the pain of
work. Often to discover that the work is quite enjoyable once started, and truly pleasurable when
complete.

### Music and Sound: Get in the Zone

Distractions: Tunnel vision is your friend.
Add distraction: You might work better with a little distraction.
Play media.
If you work better with music or movies playing in the background (which some people do,
because it may quell the desire to switch tasks, or it may dull some of their conscious to leave
some other parts of the brain to be more effective). This is actually done with transcranial
magnetic stimulation as well. If you stop some of the interfering things that are going on in the
brain, it will amplify your ability to do some other things.
Music can change the way you feel. If what you feel affects how you perform, then it’s an
obvious that for some, listening to music can enhance performance. Lots of people that jog or
work out hard in the gym have some playlists just for that activity.
Music can change the way you feel. If what you feel affects how you perform, then it’s an
obvious that for some, listening to music can enhance performance. Lots of people that jog have
some playlists just for that activity.
Thus, if you’re one that enjoys music, you’ll find that most of the best music has a YouTube
video to go with it. And some of the 2nd tier music, assuming you have tastes similar to other


YouTube users, has non directed, weaker videos, usually of a spectrum analyzer jumping around,
or some other non-specific filler content.
In conclusion, the tips are:

1. Click “next” faster on songs that don’t have real videos directed specifically for them,
because they’re less likely to be good, if you have common tastes.
2. Keep the YouTube window minimized so the cool and well done video doesn’t distract you
from your work and use hotkeys to click next or pause when needed. Unless you can ignore the
video and still benefit from it being there. That is entirely dependent on how accurate your
opinion is of whether you work better under silence, or audio only, or audio and video together.
If there’s a difference at all.

XX (this should be made into an app, it gives you the benefits of time dilation ((if you’re
male) (from red color)) and it gives you the subconscious focus and drive and competitiveness
that comes from seeing a mate you desperately want (thesaurus desperately)

If you work to make a nice playlist, save it, then you don’t have to do the work again, or you
can just use other people’s playlists, to save time, or discover new media.
Enjoy the silence. Your creative mind will fill the gap with music of its own. Let the sound of
your fingers on keys be your music. Do things worth writing about, or write about things worth
doing.
When you feel like you must stop, you must program your brain to think, “Great, that’s the
trigger for me to continue!” Like an infinite loop. It will stop on its own eventually, no reason to
help it fail early by not using it. Remember the phrase, “If I can’t, I must.”

## Execute

```
Execute and share your ideas
Doing your ideas instead of writing about them
Put first things first
Whatever you put second sometimes never happens.
Do things in the right order
```

If you’re making a cake, you need to mix the batter before you try to bake the cake. If you
don’t, you’re never going to produce an actual cake.
Tony thinks you should coin the term of doing the amplifying stuff first, perhaps using the
order of operations moniker.

### Become a Productivity God

Find an edge somewhere - working on a weekend night can be the difference between those
who win and those who work for those who win.
Collecting things and following through on a task and getting a minimum viable product and
getting your essential fatty acids and doing a little bit of everything to get a complete useful thing
is important. Prevent yourself from overdoing one aspect, and then running out of money or
steam before you can get any type of business done and signalling cleaning up your nest.
Showing people that you have the ability to both organize and acquire things from the outside
world and manipulate them into the way that you like is a reason that collecting things exist; it’s
signalling to others that you can manipulate the world around you. And find things that other
people can’t find and maintain them in addition to all the other defective parts.

## Persist

Do what you’re supposed to.
There’s all kinds of ways that you can enhance the likelihood that you will actually do what
you’re supposed to do.
Non-violent crime, patience
Some people are (and should be) enraged with every new violent crime that is listed in the
news that is the result of some backwards, cancerous culture. Cancer culture is the worst kind.
Tolerance is weakness disguised as virtue, similar to patience.
Now let’s say that properly and reasonably applied tolerance and patience is surely virtuous
however it comes, not in name, but in application. If you are patient about breathing, you may
surely die. If you are tolerant of ingesting poisons, you may surely also die, tolerance and
patience have their place, and you must harshly have adjudicated where and when they may be
employed, and when they need be banished.


### Being Creative and Momentum

Being creative is a lot like pull-ups, it’s quite easy to improve it, once you are doing it. It does
take concentration and effort, and your body may be trying to tell you to stop, but perseverance
is the key; being creative and productive is quite the same. Creativity is a muscle and the more
often you use it, and try using it at different speeds and in different ways, the stronger that
muscle gets.
Break the anti-lock brakes of life

#### Anti-lock brakes

Anti-locking brakes work by making sure your tires never get into sliding friction and they
stay in starting friction. Because sliding friction is really low and starting friction is really high.
Life has the brakes on you. Life is making sure that you don’t kick ass and slide forward through
life and go really fast through life and get a lot of stuff done. By making everything just hard
enough. That’s why you can’t break into the zone, break into the sliding friction. It just makes
everything just hard enough. It’s just hard enough to get a phone number. It’s just hard enough to
get a credit card. It’s just hard enough to get a storefront. It’s just hard enough to do these things.
But if you’re able to break through the anti-lock brakes of life, if you’re able to break through the
difficulties, then maybe you just slide right on through. That that’s the reason that it’s very easy
to keep doing something that you’ve done for a couple weeks. It’s very, very hard to start out,
that is the anti-lock braking system of life.

#### Torque curve.................................................................................................................

All right, it’s analogy time. You spend your time going out and getting drunk and using what
you’ve got, doing sales instead of product development and research and development moving
yourself up the attractiveness food chain. In an ideal world, the top 10% of guys get the top 10%
of girls, and then on down the way, then you have variants for people that got lucky or are
willing to work harder, hooked up with people with weird brain mutations. You’ve got this
analogy between business, product development, pricing, framing, and brute cold-calling sales.
Those things are kind of opposites, you have to choose, and you’re going to do one or the other.


That’s how it works; employees cost money, employees take time, you have finite time, you
have finite money; you either choose to do one or the other. Step 2, just like a car, if you have a
really big engine it’s going to output lots of torque and it’s going to be hard to use because it’s
going to spin the tires and that’s going to have a lower RPM max because it’s heavier. Then,
there comes along a smaller turbo engine that can outperform on the top end but not as much on
the low end because of the leg right.
What if you turbo the giant motor? Well now you can do things that the little motor could
never do. Because the little motor is already at the top of its game.
It’s like buying an M3 from BMW, can’t do anything to it before they had turbos when
they’re naturally aspirated. It was already maxed out. You can maybe spend a couple thousand
dollars and get a few horsepower. But if you get an M3 with a turbo now you know you change
the software map in a chip and it just boosts more at more rpm ranges and now you’re just
pumping out more power for nearly free.
In life there’s this choosing the shape of your torque curve and choosing the shape of your
horsepower curve. Getting more area under the curve is better than getting a giant peak saying
that’s how much power your motor puts out but only does it for a second, right before red line or
it only does it for a second before it overheats. That same type of distribution of energy and
getting more area under the curve kind of applies to other areas of human endeavour, such as
being fit or being wealthy or being happy or finding love in your life. Some would say that they
would rather have fewer absolutely amazing experiences than more mediocre experiences.

### The Power of Persistence

Power is energy over time. Like a solar sail, just a little bit of energy in the right place and
environment, over a long time leads to massive velocity.

## Improve


Keep getting better
If you’re not perfect, keep getting better.
Disproving the stupid, asymmetric warfare
There are easy and hard things to do in this world. Multiplication is easy, division is hard. Just
as it’s very easy to create new ideas that have no basis in reality. We call it fiction. It’s the most
popular content on the planet. Fiction is easy to create. Sadly, as fiction is multiplication,
disproving fiction is division. Division is how you undo multiplication, and truth finding is how
you undo fiction, which unfortunately is a losing battle. For every 1 hour of fiction creation
requires 10 or 100 hours of disproving. For this reason Scivive must speak as much as possible
direct truth, rather than the truth dirtied by touching the ever-expanding fictions of the world.

### The Stagnation of Great People.........................................................................................

It is unfortunate that great minds like Aubrey de Grey, Ray Kurzweil, and nearly all other
speakers including Tony Robbins seem to get to a level and just stay there, their talks don’t
evolve. They say the same crap for years, it hasn’t evolved, and you can’t really enjoy watching
it again once you can tell what they’re selling as well as they can. Why is there this stagnation?
Why doesn’t the same interesting thought processes, focuses, and processing power lead them to
a refinement and development of what is worth listening them speak about? Have they nothing
more interesting to say? Perhaps that’s one of the advantages fiction has, you’re really not likely
to be writing and selling the same book again and again over the years. You’re really expected to
be novel and new.
If you take a guy like the waitbutwhy.com guy, he never has the same things to say, because
he’s more focused on spreading newly discovered ideas and information he’s researched than he
is saying yesterday’s interesting things over and over again.
Why do artists and directors start to lose greatness over time? Is it because they’re returned to
the state they existed in before they were awesome, which was non awesome? Or is it a different
form of failure, is it that they stop searching, stopped experimenting, and stopped paying homage
to other great things. If you think you’re the smartest guy you know, or the smartest guy around,
there’s no reason trying to learn from other people, right? Don’t make the same mistake these
guys did resting on their laurels. Whatever you did that caused you to transition from being
mediocre, to being good, you should probably keep doing that.


If you change your horse midstream, particularly to a worse horse that’s nothing like the
original horse, you’re probably doing it wrong. What you’ll see in many great companies and
artists, and even cars, is a gradual refinement and progression, more so that just giving up
entirely on the old things, and just doing the new thing.
It could also be the case that whatever mistakes and missteps that truly great artists and
companies need to watch out for, are nowhere similar to what you need to watch for. If you’ve
never achieved greatness, you don’t need to worry about losing it. This is more of the
opportunity cost of changing stuff. If you already type 100 wpm, and you change to another
keyboard or system, you could lose 50 wpm. If you’re terrible at typing, and only do 20wpm,
well, if you cut your performance in half, you only lose 10 wpm. Thus it costs more of the
successful to experiment. It costs more for the wealthy when they make mistakes, if you look at
this in flat dollar cost. An already great artist has lots to lose if he switches from the rare state of
excellence into the experimental state that was similar to non-excellence whence he came.
If you’re not perfect, keep getting better.
Perfection is rare, thus progress should be common. If your model of the world hasn’t
changed in 20 years, then you are not making progress. What’s more likely, that your model is
perfect, or you’ve stopped caring?

### Preparation Application Ratio

There’s something Scivive will call the preparation-application ratio, and basically you will
hear, and maybe miss-attribute it, that Abraham Lincoln said, “Give me six hours to chop down a
tree, and I’ll spend the first four sharpening my axe.” There’s many different useful variations of
similar ideas, such as “Give me a lever long enough and I can move the world” or “The early
bird gets the worm.” What are these things? When preparation meets opportunity, that’s what
luck is. There’s all these statements regarding the effectiveness of preparation. Good outcomes
are not universally affected in the same way by good preparation. In some places preparation
leads to amazingly great force multiplication, and in other places good preparation doesn’t make
much of a difference.
Let’s say you’re planning to go to a weightlifting championship, and you’ve been training for
six months, lifting weights constantly to get ready, and you miss your last work out. How much
of an effect is that going to have on you? Probably not very much. You might even do better


depending on whether you have been over-training or not. Now let’s say you’re going to sit
down to eat dinner and you’ve got Sloppy Joe sitting in front of you but no bread, just pulled
pork and you have to choose whether you’re going to just try to eat it with your hands or get up
and get a fork. In this case the time spent getting a fork is going to pay off huge, just in the
savings of having the not look like an animal when you’re eating and clean the your hands
repeatedly, because it’s going to be really messy.
There’s places where preparation is very important and pays off really well and there’s places
where preparation is really just application. Like sharpening your axe and using your axe have
nothing in common. The preparation is like orthogonal. It’s like at right angles to its related but
not the same thing. Sharpening your axe and like chopping a tree down with your axe, they don’t
have anything in common.
However, in painting and in learning how to paint you’re just painting, right? You’re not
cleaning your brushes. You’re just painting. There’re some things where preparation is identical
to application and you’re just doing it for lots of time and then there’s other places where
preparation has nothing to do with application. It seems to be that those places get much more
bang for the buck.
For instance, if you had to practice opening lines if you like to go out into public and meet
people, and you use openers to like meet new people, whatever your opener happens to be. You
can sit at home and practice it against the wall. Or you could try it out in public it’s probably
better to try the public option. Learning some new ones that you didn’t previously know, that’s
different, right? Because you’re getting information from somewhere that’s not yourself and that
would be more of like a sharpening an axe type of behaviour. Again, when opportunity meets
preparation that’s luck. It’s unfortunate that we can’t just assign a flat percentage of time that
you should assign to improvement, development and then this is the percentage of time that you
could assign application. There are too many variables depending on the actions.
You can’t invent such a percentage, because of that wild difference between some
preparations only are just doing the same of the thing and so that really the preparation is just
more application. Then other things where the preparation isn’t application at all. Having a fork
is so useful compared to just like trying to eat food with your hands if it’s a messy food. That’s
another type of sideways preparation, having some type of sculpted metal tool has nothing in
common with sticking food in your mouth with your hands and chewing it with your mouth.


The forms of preparation that have the most payoff in the least time are those where the
preparation is most different from the application. Sharpening an axe is very useful, because it
has no similarity to the actual application of the axe towards its target. It’s also only as useful as
your axe was dull in the first place. Over-preparation in one area leads to under preparation in
another.
Scivive likes the idea of not all years of experience having the same value. There’s a great
comic: Do eighty one-year-old babies have eighty years of combined experience?

## Balance

Amplified Activity / rest states (crash and burn for profit)
CPUs and many creatures have periods of activity and periods of rest, and the cyclical nature
provides them with results and efficiency superior to a more constant lower volatility state. It’s
why animals pounce. It’s why boxers cock their fists back before releasing them forward. And if
it works at that level, it’s very likely that one level extra on top of it, by having stimulants push
you harder, and then crashing to lower, is likely an effective way to compound what the normal
activity / rest states are doing for you.
You can see other examples of this such as “work sprints.” HIIT training. Even chewing and
eating works this way.

Tasks

### The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with
the time they have, rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-
minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.
The way the Pomodoro system works is by forcing you to take a break, so you feel greedy
about getting the most of what seems limited, and in that system you’re always limited! It’s


using time limits to create scarcity and rarity, and your subconscious responds to that by wanting
to do what it’s doing harder as long as you can because you’ll run out of time soon.
It’s a way to use scheduling to make the time you have to do work limited, and therefore
increase your conscious and subconscious desire to do that thing that you know you need to do.
It also reduces the perceived cost you have to start working on a thing because it makes the
amount of time you can put into the thing more limited, which makes the thing seem like a
smaller investment and therefore reduces starting friction.
This strategy of time gating is one of a few ways you can kick more ass on tasks. There’s
others like the Dickens Process where you focus on what the real cost to your life will be if you
continue to engage in disempowering behaviours, and you can amplify the negative feelings
associated with doing the wrong stuff and the great feelings from doing the right stuff. The
Dickens Process is a Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) technique and a process of
transformation popularised by Tony Robbin’s seminars and highlighted in Tim Ferriss’ Tools of
Titans book. The Dickens Process is based on the character of Scrooge in Charles Dickens’
novella “A Christmas Carol.” Scrooge meets a ghost on Christmas Eve night, and is shown what
his future will be if he doesn’t change his current bad behaviour and limiting beliefs. The
knowledge frightens Scrooge so much that he decides to change his life.

### A Lack of Balance

A lack of balance is the definition of pain on the cellular level. If you want to unlock a door,
you need the key to move the tumblers to allow the cylinder to turn, only the correct balance of
height of each tumbler will allow to work, and you find that same kind of required balance
solution to everything else in the world as well. For you to be able to classify the thing as a thing,
for instance an open lock, it needed to be lined up the right way first.
If you didn’t have the lock balanced and able to unlock, you wouldn’t be able to classify it as
an unlocked door. This is worthy of mention it because it exists with all matter, if there are too
many atoms of one kind instead of another, you have a whole another material. For instance, if
you change the ratio of hydrogen and oxygen, you would no longer produce water, and even
amongst those atoms, if you move some electrons around, you no longer have the same atom any
more. At some point, the value of seeing that everything contains balance is a little tautological


because by definition if it wasn’t’ in balance, it would cease to be that thing, and it would instead
be a different, unbalanced thing.
Maybe the world would be better off if we saw balance as a solution of sorts; it’s a pretty
easy shortcut to see that you shouldn’t overdo some things. The more solution based, perhaps
containing more input variables to measure whether a thing was “in balance” or not, may be
technically more accurate, but at the cost of ever being useful in day to day life. You have to
admit, many folk have neither the ability nor inclination to overthink things, nor often
moderately think about things, so perhaps it is better that we keep the marketing up for balance
instead of multi input solution based measurements.
There’s this balance between conserving energy and finding new awesome resources. And
it’s not just new resources that are physical in the real world, but mental ones as well because
there’s always a better way to understand the thing. There’s always a thing that can be learned,
so to speak. And that progress led to tools, language, writing, city-states, and nation-states. When
you are feeling guilty that you haven’t had the type of progress and production that you think is
possible in your life, it definitely is possible. However, unless you’re some lucky mutant, you are
going to need to bust your ass and use your brain, thoughts the right way and schedule the right
things. Either have the world’s best discipline or be a lucky mutant or understand that it’s a fight
and it’s a battle.

### A Singular Focus Leads to Neglect

If you dedicate yourself in a direction so hard and immerse yourself so hard in a behaviour or
an outcome, you begin to see the whole world through that lens. It affects what you think is
important, it affects how you spend your time, it affects who you meet, it affects where you exist
and most of your life will be muted, deleted and unseen. You might neglect family relationships,
you might neglect showering, you might neglect knowing about the news or brushing your teeth
or eating. When you are so in a fixed state and addicted and single minded and purpose and
focused, there’s the risk that you have great personal pain during those rare moments when you
notice that you sacrificed much of what you might want in your life for a different goal either by
choice or by obsession; either through a healthy decision or by having no choice and having an
addiction.


## Habits

### The Benefits of Coaching

Tips for executing your vision in the real world.
If you want to help yourself get something creative done, or something hard done, you may
benefit from having a partner or coach that you answer to, one that expects you to perform. It’s
much easier to let yourself down than it is to let your friends/employees/coaches down. They will
hold you to a tighter schedule. You will deprive yourself of sleep, which enhances the chance
that you will go to sleep earlier that day, which increases the chance that you will wake up at the
right time the next day so as to be effortlessly awake and able to put first the things that are most
important to you.

#### Pay a coach

Now you’re paying to have someone that you don’t want to let down. It’s harder to let him
down than yourself.

#### Work with a coach regularly

If you don’t have someone to hold you to that higher standard than you would naturally have,
you will sleep in, and you will then go to sleep later at night. You might find yourself on a 26
hour long cycle when the days are only 24 hours long, and unable to stay synced up with any of
the other people that you should be using to help you be productive. You will be operating on the
opposite schedule of other business you need to work with, and perhaps the stores you might be
using to acquire food, services, etc.

### Keep Personal Commitments Private

This one is dangerous, many people make a commitment to do a thing, they tell all their
friends about it publicly. Then they proceeded to do the much easier thing, which is to go back
into doing the old behaviour they were trying to get out of, and just never mention it again in the
hopes their friends forgot about it too. You may fail to do what you said you would so often that


you just don’t even care to pretend to be reliable or truthful in your personal declarations in
regards to what you will do, or when you will do it.
Thus if you commit to do things often, and don’t do them often, you have strengthened your
loser muscle, and increased your loser momentum. It would have been better for you to have
remained silent and been a loser in quiet instead of training negative and training to break
commitments and be untrustworthy. The later added insult to injury basically.

### Starting & Finishing

Two statements appear to be true: “Stop starting new things, focus on finishing.” That one
works if you already started on something.
The other one is, “stop focusing on finishing, focus on starting.” That one works if you
haven’t started yet. They sound like opposites, but they’re both equally true at different times.
If you haven’t already started, do so. If you’ve already started however, finish.

### Doing the Right Thing Is Easier the Longer You Do It

The hard part of working out a gym is getting to the gym. Once you’re there, everything is
easy, you just hit the weights autonomously. Getting there however is difficult; there are all
kinds of good excuses to put it off until later. That’s because you think that you get to modify the
behaviour, you think it’s ok if you don’t go, you export the real cost of not going. You see, when
you don’t go a single time to the gym, you think that the entire cost of that not going is
encapsulated in that single workout that you missed. Not everyone accurately accounts for the
fact that with every single workout you miss, you are more and more likely to miss more
workouts.
This isn’t a way to understand only gym attendance, this is a way to understand all of the
behaviours you have in your life both good and bad. The longer you do a thing, the more muscle
memory and subconscious- driven it becomes, the better you get at it, the more you enjoy doing
it, and the less you feel like it’s something optional that you can displace with whatever else
shows up. In this life, the things that we are most likely to get are the things that we MUST get.
The things that are MUSTS’s go first, and everything else takes a back seat. In a world of limited
time, limited resources, and limited willpower to do what you know you should is mandatory.


Scivive doesn’t know which of the awesome behaviours you could have in your life you’re
currently trying to integrate, but is confident these tactics will help you make it happen.
When you’re good at the level you’re at, you move on to the next level, and you get whole
new problems. If you ask a really handsome guy how to meet girls, he’ll tell you just smile. You
ask an ugly guy the same question, he’s going to tell you every trick in the book. Same for
business, guy who gets lucky, picks the right business, he gets to have a whole new problem
about scaling and regulations and such. But the guy who doesn’t get lucky, picks a hard business
that’s been around for a long time, boy he’s got to fight for every nickel.

### Beware Eliminating a Bad Habit

Don’t take away the profitable inaccurate belief someone has unless you have the time and
likelihood that you can give them a better one that sticks. If you only take and don’t give, nature
abhors a vacuum, and they might replace the old pitfalls with new, worse pitfalls. Some people
might replace cigarettes with cocaine instead of exercise.

### Wager Money on Yourself

Bet on your progress, for if you fail, you’ll lose money. Here’s the screwy part, the people
that have enough money to try this one are the least likely to care about losing the money.
Perhaps the wealthy care more about a loss of status than wealth.

### Gamification Tactics for Useful Behaviours......................................................................

Some good tactics should be stolen from the cancerous, casual gaming wallet-emptying
strategies that casinos use. Maybe time gating can get people to write books, that’s what the
Pomodoro method is right? What other tactics could work? Jingling sounds in the “casino
acoustics” genre? They’ve found a way to addict humans to useless behaviours, let’s find ways
to addict humans to useful ones!
You get what you focus on, so do others it seems, they sense your focus and may understand
what you are trying to accomplish.
It’s funny how what you read during the day is what other people are working on and their
opinions of what they’ve read. So the more popular and worked on a thing is, the more worked


on and popular it will be in the short and medium term. Think of how many copies of the same
movie you’ve seen come out at the same time; nearly the same movie, twin movies they’re
called. (Armageddon and Deep Impact, for example)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films
This is the kind of thing that happens in business and art and all things that involve humans’
attention as well. Someone gets a good idea, mentions it, now it’s another person’s good idea
too. This is a reason that jealousy and competition are closely related concepts in that, you
become aware of a strategy that works and gets a result you want, and now you want to compete
and dominate by doing the same.
You could actually use this tactic against other countries to make them less effective by
convincing the people of that country that certain members of their group were benefitting from
an actually stupid behaviour, say winning at video games. Then this would addict other citizens
of that country to want to compete in that thing. Perhaps gaming is too fun to make fun of. Think
of the classic “pissing contest,” could there be a larger waste of time than to see who can piss
farther? Now imagine that it’s not so obvious, or tripped enough interesting human triggers, and
now it’s an addiction. How much of our disempowering addictions and habits are the result of
entering our consciousness through someone else falling for the addiction, and so the virally bad
behaviour has its “patient zero,” through which it infects the rest of us.
This happens internally in your own life without looking at anyone else at all. The things you
are used to doing, you’ll want to continue doing, and the things that you’re not used to doing are
more likely to be stopped. So the lesson is, if you starve the bad behaviours, you forget to do
them, because you’re too busy doing the new ones that you’ve done long enough to stick. Thus,
starve the bad behaviours for three weeks, and see them become weak. Engage the new
behaviours for three weeks and see them become stronger.

### NonZero Days

This timing is probably dependent on the individual but they’re only matters of degree. This
is the same reason it’s so important to be very serious about not having long breaks when you’re
doing a new workout plan, or perhaps whatever else your new year’s resolution might have been.
Those little missed instances of the new behaviour you are supposed to be doing are the virus of
bad behaviour trying to get a foot hold, and each consecutive screw up is vastly more dangerous


than the last. When you’ve missed probably four or five instances of a thing in a row, you just
might never get around to it again. Maybe next year. This trend, combined with it being easier to
keep doing a thing once you’ve started, where 80 per cent of the mental hardness of a thing is
getting yourself to start, and 20 per cent is actually the doing of the thing, those two things are
why no zero days works well as a strategy for performance. You don’t have to kick all the ass in
the world, but you must have zero days in which you do nothing.

### Stop Dreaming and Start Doing

You focus on what you don’t want only long enough to invert it, and find what you do want,
so you can focus on that. Then, you actually don’t focus on what you do want either. You should
only focus on what you do want long enough to calculate the stuff you need do to get it, and then
you focus on that. Once you know what you need to do to get stuff, you don’t focus on those
things anymore, you focus on your schedule, and hitting your short term goals. If you look at the
things you want, you are not looking at what you need to do. If you are looking at what you don’t
want, you are not looking at what you need to do.
Only action matters, and dreaming is only useful to action as long as you need it to create the
plan. Once you have the plan, stop dreaming and start doing. Your goals and dreams are really
only as useful as they point to correct actions you take. Your knowledge of correct actions are
only as useful as you can actually act on them.
Focus on the results your decisions will get you
Time shifting can save you or drown you. If you’re going to optimize for the future, stay
focused on it, and feel good. If you’re going to optimize for the present, stay focused on the
present and feel good. If you make choices for the future, but only focus on the present, you’ll be
unhappy, and vice versa.
We want cake now, and we want to be skinny in the future. We don’t want to do our
homework now, but we want good grades. Because they are binary propositions, you can’t have
your cake and eat it too, so to speak, you always can be unhappy. If you eat your cake now, you
can mess your happiness up by thinking about fat future you. If you don’t have the cake,


focusing on fit future you, you maybe mess up the present, regretting not eating the cake. If you
want it, the unhappiness of not getting the other things on the menu, because you can only
choose one, is always there to help make you unhappy. Obviously more choices should make
you happier. Oddly enough, in the real world it doesn’t, and it’s actually scientifically proven to
make you less happy.

### The Dissatisfaction of Too Many Choices

Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies: freedom
of choice. In Schwartz’s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not
happier but more dissatisfied. More choices leads to unhappiness, partly because you can’t feel
good knowing you made the right choice, when there’s too many choices. This is also why most
sales optimized websites offer you three price points to choose from, not because they have to, or
because it even makes sense, but because you will feel better choosing one, and they will make
more sales, and happier customers.

### All Choices Have Consequences

There’s this concept of heads I win tails you lose—which is similar to the Catch 22 —which is
similar to the damned if you do damned if you don’t. Scivive is going to add a new level of
resolution on understanding to the concept. What will happen is, you’ll make a decision based on
a feeling that you have. Let’s take cheating on a diet for example. You’ll say: “It is summer” or
“I’ve had some drinks” or “It’s Friday” or “I’ve been doing good on my diet” or whatever excuse
is. Then you’ll say: “You know what, I want to treat myself and I’m going to have something
that tastes really good.” and that’s not the problem. The problem is, that you get some of the
taste, and a lot of it you swallow so quickly that your poor little tongue doesn’t even get a chance
to enjoy it.
You have to keep stuffing more in there to get the flavour. Sometimes you’re engaged in
conversation or listening to music or listening thinking about the future thinking about the past.
You’re halfway done with your dessert and you don’t even remember what it tastes like. Because
you weren’t paying attention. If you were to die after that moment, that would be a good decision
statistically. The chance that you die after that dessert is very low. Therefore you live, and live


long enough to regret that decision. What does that regret look like? How is it similar to all the
other regrets that you have for decisions that you made that were the right thing at the time, but
wasn’t the best thing for your future self?
Food is one of them. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips. Let’s say you have a lot of
money. You say, “You know what I have a lot of money and I don’t like spending it shipping. I
don’t like spending on transporting things. I don’t particularly like shipping fees. If I buy
something I might as well buy two of them to save on shipping.” Unless it’s food and it rapidly
spoils. If something doesn’t rapidly spoil and doesn’t rapidly depreciate and you can save on
shipping fees and save on the concept of adding to shopping cart and going through checkout
process and finding it again. Then you might as well buy two.
It makes total complete sense when you do it. Then future you comes along. The future you
is optimizing for a different set of outcomes. That person says “I want more space in my house
and a better version of this thing.” Now future you wants to sell the thing.
This is one example you could use food. Where you’re fat and looking at your stomach,
going: “how did we get here?” Compared to when you’re at lunch going: “You know I’m sick of
dieting, I just want to enjoy some food for once.” The right decision for one moment and the
short amount of time thereafter, is a wrong decision for another time and it is a real-life
execution of the damned if you do, damned if you don’t based on time. The level of abstraction,
the extra level of understanding that is sticking on top of this, that “damned if you do damned if
you don’t,” appears to apply to a specific slice of time, which is nearby. Whereas the
understanding that Scivive is trying to impart, is not that “you’re damned if you do damned if
you don’t,” but that you’re not damned now, you are damned then. The reason for that is because
your desire changes, your goals change.

### Time Shifting: When Do You Want Your Pain?

Now this has been explained in other words and analysing why it is that, right before you’re
about to go to sleep you dream of conquering the world and doing all of these wonderful things
that you’ve never done before. Learning a new language and learning to dance and seeing the
world and writing that novel you’ve always been meaning to write. Eating more healthily and
going to gym all that bullshit seem so easy and so nearby and so motivating when you’re about


to go to sleep. This is because you get all of the feelings of the benefits with none of the cost that
you shortly have to actually do the tasks as soon as you wake up.
Then the beginning of the new day comes and you’re not about to go to sleep, you have an
actual opportunity to do these things. The benefit seems just as real however, the cost seems so
very much larger. Because you would have to put down the croissant, grab some salad or just
enjoy the feeling of being hungry.
That time shifting in your own mind which is documented elsewhere in the book, because it
has been studied, that time shifting in your mind screws you so that whatever decision you make
that would be right in the short term, will screw you over with interest later. People have
difficulty finding a good way to overcome because there isn’t a good way to overcome it. You
either learn to time shift in your brain and try and cancel out the effects of this real-world time
shifting, so you take the world time shifting of: “I’m going to not eat this delicious food now, so
that I can have fitness later.”
You try and shift your mind to match the reality and the reality is, you’re going to try and
shift those future benefits into the present. You’re going to try and feel those future benefits in
the present. In neuro-linguistic programming they call it future pacing. That’s the best chance
you have of feeling good while depriving yourself of something that would quite easily and quite
readily bring you emotional joy.
Who doesn’t enjoy the feeling of filling up on delicious cake? The exception is people with
mental illnesses like anorexia or people that have trained themselves to deliberate action over
and over and over again to hunt something else, like fitness. They don’t have room for cake
because they’re so busy ingesting kale or whatever other horrible tasting bland foods they have
found a way to addict themselves to.
The important part of this summary is that you are (or will be) “damned if you do damned if
you don’t.” Beware of the “Catch 22” of each action. Prepare for the “the screwing you get for
the screwing you got.”
That other reference that they’ve studied involves some word like “satiation.” Whenever you
make a decision to save money now, you hurt now but gain later.

### The Grass Is Always Greener on the Other Side................................................................


By the way, the grass is always greener on the other side. The problem with the grass being
greener on the other side is, it means that no matter what side you pick when you look at the
other grass it appears greener. The funny part is that you could actually like have factual
representation physically because your perspective of the grass changes for when you’re standing
directly above it and for when you’re viewing it from the side. That also mirrors what would be
expected in reality because these plants, the whole reason they have leaves, or foliage
whatsoever, is to absorb light from the Sun. And, the Sun is always above them. Whereas you as
a human are only above, in a similar position to the Sun, that grass which is directly below you.
The saying that the grass is always greener on the other side, it may not just be a
colloquialism. It may actually have physical optical representation in the real world. This would
be interesting to study. Why would a plant spend time, whatever optical properties a plant has
from the side are very likely and predictably different from the optical properties it would have
from above. Because it gets its energy from above eighty per cent more than it gets its food from
the side.
Moral of the story: you’re going to make decisions that you regret no matter what. Because
what you optimize for in the short term is not going to be the same thing in the long term. As you
flip flop between the two, you can’t win. “I saved all this money to build a big business. But I
can’t buy back those years of decreased quality of life by not spending that money earlier; and
I’m with one girl therefore I’m not with another girl.” How do you win that one? Be with no
girls? Be with all the girls?
Order of operations - Behaviours
If you were a hippy tree hugger before your Tony Robbins event, you will be a larger one
after the event. If you were a money hungry business killing machine before, now you’re a
bigger money hungry killing machine. Same applies to meditation and money, if you adopted
meditation because you wanted to become more powerful in business, it’s likely your meditation
will bring you there.

### Loserness Momentum / Routine........................................................................................

It’s funny, if you have a weekend, life’s good and on Monday you can function well; if you
have a three-day weekend, even better, yay, more rest and relaxation. On day four though, you
become a zombie and forget how to function as a human being. Schedules shaving, showering,


these things all become optional. It’s an example of if you have a cheat day or slip a little bit,
now you’re in rolling friction instead of starting friction, and it’s easier to keep slipping, just like
locking up your brakes on a car or slipping on ice.

### Cheat Days Add Up

Diet immersion, slower loss = more risk at least.
If you go out with friends, they hold you to old lifestyle habits, and don’t count calories, and
you eat more of the tasty food because it tastes good, and you try more items because you don’t
go out that often. A single cheat day leads to more cheat days. The slower you lose your first
kilogram of fat, the more likely you are to give up before you ever build the habit that makes
continuing easy.

### Don’t Call Personal Excellence “Self-Help”

Don’t confuse personal excellence with “self-help.” Calling books on how to kick ass “self-
help” is kind of stupid, because it’s quite often that the people that read these books are far
beyond the needing of help than those that are smart enough to read this excellent and life
changing material over all of the other options on the book shelves. Who came up with that
dumb ass title? How is personal excellence in any way similar to “self-help”?
Do you even produce, bro?
Yeah, I’d better produce this book quick. Because when I have to start repeating content -
because it’s been so long since I said it, that I don’t remember whether I said it or not. I’m going
to have a lot of fucking duplicates.

### Tortured Geniuses

This one is about tortured geniuses. Isn’t it interesting that some of the most productive and
effective people in the world are tortured? Some would say that they are tortured and productive
because that productivity relieves their pain just ever so slightly. Whereas these hippie bastards
spend all their time “happy as could be,” they but don’t have to produce for happiness and thus
they don’t produce, and thus they have worse health and countries without borders being taken
over by their neighbours.


To tell you the truth that behaviour is kind of selected against. They’re going to be extinct
unless the world becomes a much friendlier place.

### Eating the Frog

Timing to do the most difficult thing first, so you can enjoy the rest of your day without it
looming over your head, is called “eating the frog.” Yes, it’s really called that.

### Repeat Positive Habits

If you feed a positive habit long enough you don’t need discipline to do it any longer. It
actually becomes harder to do the other thing that you used to do.
Reminding you to do something that you already know you should be doing, like a greatest
hits list of tasks that you should be doing, is more important than adding a new novel thing to the
long list of stuff that you don’t do.
When you’re trying to change the way you think about things, you have two options: you can
either immerse yourself or make thinking the right way so easy that it’s what you do. You wake
up, you don’t care whether you feel like it or not, you do the thing that you’re supposed to do;
it’s scheduled and you just do it. It doesn’t take will power because it’s engrained as a habit.
Don’t spend your time leeching human consciousness via games that produce nothing when
you could be solving things that matter.
I was addicted to games for a decade or so. For at least two decades I almost had a crippling
game addiction. If you are quite lucky to have achieved enough to get a lot of free time, you
know, yeah, I spent years on those games. But I got nothing out except the ability to confess how
horrible it was.
Moreover, there are teams of people who are very well paid and very intelligent; their only
goal is to make you addicted. They are paid to abuse your own psychology, to damage your
personality, to destroy themselves and the world we are living in. They may make money, but
they have sold their souls, and they may not realize it until it is too late.


## Stolen and Wasted Time.....................................................................................................

In a world of limited resources, when you assign too much energy to a particular task, the
system works less well. If you spend all your time absorbing content and not creating any, well
then, you’re not adding anything to the world. You’re just the world’s worst version of Google.
You should never spend your time checking things. If things need checking, let another
human or some mechanism like ifthisthenthat.com, IFTTT. Then let it just trigger to tell you
maybe you shouldn’t check defaults, subreddits or any Reddits whatsoever. Maybe you should
customize the Reddits.
Sports are a means to an end. The end is love and significance. It’s important to not see them
as ends. How important is our ability to put a rubber ball through a piece of metal / a basketball,
soccer ball, football. How much time should we spend on this?
If we had to go to war, and we had to win, and we had a way to consume the enemies’
population with gaming, they surely would lose that war, perhaps even before their 10th
achievement trophy.
How gross is it that teams and teams of people are sitting in rooms right now, scheming of
ways to addict the youth to basically mental death? This might be exaggerating a bit, because
games you participate in are way better than games you just watch. Participating beats the crap
out of spectating. Sadly though, the same mental triggers that have served us so well throughout
the years are stealing away from us our ability to reach the next level. The level where we don’t
become permanently extinct.
If you spend your time figuring out how to brainwash kids to grind and grind out the same
recycled garbage content, and sacrifice their life force and time to get another gem, or sword or
gun, or trophy, the world should hate you, sincerely. Can you please take your manipulation
skills and brainwashing skills and gamification skills, and go gamify the real world, so we can
survive. Many people become addicted to these products, and often regret it later in life. Even
the slave masters are slaves. How fun must it be to create ways to addict people to beat the same
boss 10 times? These games steal your soul even while you sleep. Your dreams are consumed by
the grind.
There was a pretty interesting interview with some suit working at Nestle, and the
interviewer asked, “You guys focus on selling healthy foods, and you sell chocolate, is the


chocolate healthy?” The guy responded in a pretty genius way. He said, “There are no unhealthy
foods, only unhealthy diets.” That’s actually legit.
It’s probably true for games as well, some gameplay is probably great for the same reason it’s
great in the wild. There’s just some things that cross the line, and when you aim for crushing
addiction and hours stolen as your goal, you’re hurting the users. Go steal someone else’s life.
When you see a movie, it has an end. When you play an MMORPG, the content creators own
your soul.
It’s not just MMORGs, its NASCAR, the NFL, you name it, they want your hours, and more
importantly they want your money. South Park had a great episode on it, making money on the
backs of the addicted. You should watch it.
Here’s the situation we’re in as human beings, one could focus on oneself and loved ones,
and on survival, in which case one may need lots of people to get their act together. If we change
our goals, and we stop caring about ourselves in the present, and begin to care only about those
that come long after us, then we can shift our focus to becoming multi-planetary. Of course, the
only way that pays off is when one of our planets gets destroyed, otherwise, the insurance policy
never really paid for itself.
Some would much rather bet the whole farm on this one egg basket not blowing up, then they
might get to survive without rolling the dice of deciding to move to Mars or not, and watching
one of the other planets fail. Who are you kidding? It is more likely that you are going to die of
some boring stuff, being complacent, a lifelong collection of should of and could of, culminating
in a whimper, not a bang.
Or we could fight, and take our destiny into our hands. We need only unplug our bad habits
from our hands and put them to good work on the world around us. Wash them first.

### The Time Sink of the Other Sex

You rarely hear about great men being womanizers or great dancers as well, for greatness
tends to require a fair amount of time to cultivate and outcompete your fellow woman, and so it’s
very likely that if you want to be greater than other people on the thing, you’ll need to put in
more focus and more time at the sacrifice of other things that they will have time for, because
they haven’t made the same sacrifices. Luckily the world is so lazy compared to what’s possible
that you don’t really have to make that many sacrifices in the grand scheme of things, because


you can get quite a lot done in the time that everyone else is literally messing around and doing
things they barely even enjoy.
Beware however that the other reason that you don’t see a lot of great men being great at
more than a single thing is because it’s also just a function of your filter; even if the other thing
that you ere selecting for wasn’t great at all, and it was just say, being six feet tall, or having
green eyes, you’d still knock out a lot of candidates just with that rather non great selector.
Being a good womanizer is very time consuming. You will spend your days hunting, and
scheming, and dating, and gaming, and “making love,” and in the end, you’re very likely to get
the same results out of it that most other men have. They in general don’t become rich, nor
powerful, for making women want to have sex with you one by one is more of a sales thing, and
less of a product development thing.

### Success/Failure Cycle Timing

Every time you go out and don’t pull (take a woman home or get her number), you have a real
cost, and unless you have much better than average state management, you will be riding a
difficult cycle. Scivive suggests only going out to pull if you can continue to do that long enough
to get a win and ride it. If you have a win, and then go cancel it out by getting a loss and riding
the loss, you’re likely to focus and feel the more recent event over the better farther away one.
This applies to games, and love, and all other matters of, rage if you lose, joy if you win; we
have emotional momentum as humans.

### The Pareto Principle

The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of
factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80 per cent of the results come from 20 per
cent of the causes or effort. This means that the next 20 per cent of results will require 80 per
cent of the effort.
Car detailers live far outside the Pareto 80 / 20 effectiveness principle. That’s why no matter
where you go in your life you could stare at a thing and make it ever so incrementally better all
day long and unless that scales to other people, if it’s only for you only for a single other person,
you’re probably wasting your time.


### Diminishing Returns

Being a jack a jack of all trades is better than going deeper into a single skill, because going to
deeper on a skill just gets you incremental returns. Whereas, it’s binary if you’re missing
components to get your business complete, you’re not yet doing business. But if you can perform
moderately at bit of all the components done, then you are in business. Then you can
incrementally improve.
You can’t really improve what doesn’t exist. Therefore being a jack of all trades and
entrepreneurship needs to come before deep diving into improvement. I think that’s the same
reason that hoarding exists. You need all of the things more than you need more of a single thing.
That’s like the concept behind essential multi-vitamins. You don’t need more, you need just that
one.

### Skill Momentum Turning Cost

If you are a complete neophyte at something, it costs you quite literally nothing to learn one
better format over a different, perhaps more common, but worse format. For example QWERTY
versus DVORAK typing. However, if you are extremely proficient at the QWERTY keyboard
format, then you will incur a gigantic up front cost to switching, that the new person doesn’t.
Thus Experts pay a much higher cost to change course than noobs. You could call this skill
momentum.

### Time Spent Recovering

Another reason endurance sports are tough is because not only do they take longer, they take
longer to recover to from too, and then you’re really tired as well. You may feel really sore, so
you not only lose the time it takes going and flopping about, you also lose the time going and
driving to where these faraway places that you can flop about in for a very long time, and then
recovering, and then being sore, and then going to sleep earlier.

### Avoid the Common Mistakes

```
Don’t sweat the small stuff, by knowing what the big stuff is.
```

One mistake people make is not noticing that they’re chasing a small percentage difference
that doesn’t matter. Another common mistake is mistaking linear changes in a number for
importance, when that change is a small percentage. What really is the difference between being
able to type 115 and 119 words per minutes? And how many hours of testing and practice eat
into whatever useful gain could be had? The time one may have spent overclocking and typing
faster will never be recovered in actuality, one may forever be cash negative on the endeavors. It
is an insurance policy that you can buy very expensively in your “free” time. That would pay in
the event that for reasons outside your control something needed to be done very rapidly, and
due to your low ROI, spending many hours making things faster, you could win back some of
the time through the increased speed. It’s like being in a race, and trying to do some pushups real
quick at the start so you could try and run faster. You would just be losing ground without much,
if any, benefit.
The time for practice and warm up exercises is before the race. Bad analogy, the idea is, if
you slow yourself down trying to go faster, it can actually be a net loss.
You might want to stick with the computer you have for as long as possible, and as far as
typing goes, don’t be surprised if Google and their Al team has speech recognition entirely
solved for English speakers in the not so distant future. In this way, technology advancement
could make all your hours of typing practice completely wasted.

### Being Great at the Wrong Things

I used to own a car stereo store, we would make peoples cars as loud as possible, particularly
in the bass area. Now when you are younger you don’t have quite the same empathy or
knowledge of what other people are thinking about you, or how you may be affecting other
people’s lives. Such was the case with the very loud vehicles I drove around.
Get this, amongst people that are into the car stereo scene, there’s actually something called a
SPL contest, or dB drag racing. Basically you armour your car, turn it into a giant concrete box,
and fill it with speakers that are only great at playing a single frequency (which is basically the
opposite of music). Then you try to hit that tone, and usually break much of the speakers and car
and amplifiers during the process. Also you most likely drove that car to the show on a trailer,
because it was far too dangerous and unreliable and slow to drive of its own volition.


Equally as stupid as incentivizing the destruction of cars into science projects to make noise
in very short bursts. I’d say drag racing and fast cars are just about as stupid. The death tolls are
gigantic, and once again I’m guilty of playing into that stereotype of boy racer as well. I wonder
if I’m executing any bad ideas disguised as good ideas right now. Come to think of it, if you look
at all the things on the magazine stand in your local book store or supermarket, I think you will
find that we humans have all kinds of inane and backwards hobbies.

### Hoarding

How about the irrational hoarding of things? If you are artful enough with it, you don’t look
like a generic “keep all things” hoarder, but to some degree you are fulfilling the same driving
impetus. You could call it a sport to find all the stupid things you’re doing that don’t fit with
what you’d say a fulfilling and rewarding life for you would look like.
It’s also funny how these things change massively with age. You don’t see a lot of young kids
worry about politics, and you don’t see a lot of 40 year old people worrying about doing BMX
tricks on their bicycle.
Some stupid things stay for the long haul, some go away, and some come anew. If you
haven’t really thought about gardening too much, but could imagine that if there was some time
of break in the normal food distribution systems, you would dearly wish that your roses were
perhaps more edible and more the size of say, pumpkins. Not very many young people that are
into gardening.

### Not Many Hours in a Day!

If you want to know how important transition time is, you basically have 16 hours left in a
day after you have sleep; and that doesn’t include the transition from waking up, brushing your
teeth, eating, talking to people, putting on clothes, taking off clothes, and driving to and from
work. So basically if you want to know how important it is to cue out transition time out of your
life, just assume that you had to spend all of your time in transition, so what if your time to and
from work, walking or driving that’s all you ever did you slept (pulled over to the side of the
road). That would be an unfulfilling life, you wouldn’t enjoy it, and so it’s very likely that


cutting that out in its entirety would add great value to your life. Meanwhile many people still
commute, on average, 45 minutes to 1 hour each way to their jobs.
Life is made of time. If you spend 25% of your working hours of a day doing something
which disappears the moment you go to sleep, it literally dies the moment you lay your head to
bed. Man, you are recreating the same work over and over and over and over and over and over
again, and it doesn’t stack, it doesn’t build, it doesn’t scale. You wouldn’t even need to do it if
everyone else would be willing to lower the arms race.

### Cutting Out Transition Time

It’s way easier to do some squats in your living room than it is to get dressed, then go to the
gym, then do squats there, then shower, then return home, and now you are back where you
could have been with 1 hour less spent. Actually an hour or more, why waste the hour of your
life? Are you actually hitting on people at the gym? If you’re not, why would you go there?
Perhaps you like sports, and that takes more people. In that case, or in any case where the hour
spent commuting and such provides any real additional benefit to you, then it could be cool.
Sadly, it’s hard to have a squash court in your building.

### Playing the Odds With Life

How much time have you wasted in the past 10 to 12 years of your life, doing things that you
can’t even remember doing now? Some of those years may have been wasted during what is
supposed to be the best years of your life, which maximizes the penalty. That’s why it’s so
important that you do things that checkpoint in your mind, you must do things that have lasting
value and impact, if not for the world, at least yourself, because one day you’ll wake up and ask
yourself, “where did my life go?” Dickens process.
That’s a time frame issue, it’s very likely that everything we do is likely to fail. It is very
likely that you are going to meet the same fate as everyone that came before you, therefore you
must play the odds. Are you on a calorie restricted diet starving yourself? Not if you love food. Is
that going to make you die earlier? Yes, very likely.
How can you do that? Well you’re playing the odds that this live forever idea doesn’t work
out anyway, and so you’ve got to get the quality while you are here, so you maybe walk a fine


line between enjoyment and savings. You walk a fine line between spending and savings,
between working out and taking a break, and maybe having a drink. And if you don’t work that
fine line and you don’t perform that balance you’re very likely to end up in pain, because a lack
of balance is the definition of pain.
